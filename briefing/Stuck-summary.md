# Current Stucks


1. **NApp-to-NApp Communication Architecture (Highest Priority for Tom)**  
   Ensure NApps can seamlessly interact, enabling dynamic orchestration (JITAs) and shared functionalities.  
   - Define protocols for NApp discovery, secure data exchange, and permission management.  
   - Integrate AI Agents for dynamic service selection and orchestrations.  
   - This serves as the platform’s “nervous system,” enabling modular interoperability.

2. **Commander Integration & Governance (Highest Priority for Scott)**  
   Implement the Commander (O1 Pro) to manage strategic and tactical tasks, track progress, re-prioritize as new data emerges, and ensure compliance with domain definitions.  
   - Establish reasoning-first workflows and evaluation pipelines.  
   - Overlord queries for clarification, integrates regulatory and identity checks, and keeps strategies aligned with project goals.

3. **Cross-Domain Integration & Economic Model Validation (Subsequent Priority)**  
   After NApp-to-NApp communication and Overlord governance are stable, harmonize decentralized AI, innovation concepts, UI strategies, and reasoning rules. Validate the economic and attribution models through simulations before large-scale feature expansions.

4. **Stuck Loop & AI-Native Blockchain Foundations (Subsequent Priority)**  
   Once core communication and Overlord management are established, implement the Stuck Loop Process, trustless collaboration, and AI-native blockchain components (Artifact, proof of inference) to ensure verifiable and trustless operations.

5. **UI Enhancements & Continuous Improvement Tools (Subsequent Priority)**  
   After fundamental pillars are in place, refine the UI so that Actors can seamlessly interact with NApps, report and resolve Stucks, and engage with the economic model. Integrate continuous improvement tools and Overlord-driven insights into the UI.

6. **NApp-to-NApp Communication Framework (Tom’s Focus)**  
   - **Description:**  
     Develop standardized interfaces for NApp communication, including messaging or function-call protocols, AI Agent integration, and mechanisms for secure data exchange and permissions.  
     Support the creation of JITAs by orchestrating multiple NApps dynamically.
   - **References:** `napp.md`, `ai-agent.md`, `universal-api-gateway.md`, `jita.md`  
   - **Estimate:** ~5 hours AI time  
   - **Priority:** Highest

7. **Commander Integration & Governance (Your Focus)**  
   - **Description:**  
     Implement the Overlord to handle strategic/tactical decision-making, maintain evaluation pipelines, and integrate domain definitions. The Overlord should dynamically reprioritize tasks, handle clarifications, and ensure compliance with regulatory and economic logic.
   - **References:** `prompts/2024-12-15-AI-OVERLORD`, `regulatory-compliance.md`, `qa.md`  
   - **Estimate:** ~5 hours AI time initial setup, ongoing maintenance  
   - **Priority:** Highest

## Subsequent Priority Tactical Tasks

1. **Economic Model Simulation Setup**  
   - **Description:**  
     Once NApp communication and Overlord governance are in place, simulate scenarios to test the Intrinsic Currency, Attribution Algorithms, and Decentralized Income flows.  
     Use Actors (Consumer, Demander, Funder, Trader, Talent) to validate the economic model and ensure sustainable value exchange.
   - **Activities:**  
     Create testing environments, run Impact Crystal analyses, and measure conversion rates from Demanders to Consumers.
   - **References:** `decentralized-income.md`, `intrinsic-currency.md`, `attribution-algorithm.md`, `impact-crystal.md`, `actor-*`  
   - **Priority:** Subsequent

2. **Stuck Loop & AI-Native Blockchain Foundations**  
   - **Description:**  
     Implement the Stuck Loop Process to identify, analyze, and resolve Direct and Implied Stucks efficiently.  
     Integrate the AI-native blockchain (Artifact) and proof of inference for verifiable, trustless operations. Ensure that Stuck resolutions feed back into the Attribution and Income systems.
   - **Activities:**  
     Set up QA pipelines for Stuck solutions, deploy Artifact-based blockchain mechanisms, and ensure reproducible and auditable computations.
   - **References:** `stuck.md`, `stuck-loop-process.md`, `artifact.md`, `decentralized-income.md`, `qa.md`  
   - **Priority:** Subsequent

3. **UI Integration Plan (Enhanced)**  
   - **Description:**  
     Improve the UI post-core infrastructure to let Actors easily find and interact with NApps, report Stucks, understand economic metrics, and utilize Overlord guidance.  
     Integrate dashboards, help panels, and context-aware interfaces driven by AI Agents.
   - **Activities:**  
     Add interfaces for Stuck reporting, NApp discovery, and attribution metrics. Enhance user stories and help documentation for seamless onboarding.
   - **References:** `napp.md`, `ai-agent.md`, `user-story.md`, `value-exchange.md`  
   - **Priority:** Subsequent

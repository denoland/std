# Interface between Domain-Dreamcatcher and Domain-Decentralized-AI

This interface file reconciles shared concepts between the `Domain-Dreamcatcher` and `Domain-Decentralized-AI` definition sets.

---

## Shared Concepts

### 1. AI Agent

**Common Definition**:

**AI Agent**

An autonomous software entity capable of performing tasks and making decisions on behalf of users or systems, utilizing artificial intelligence techniques.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Assists Consumers by optimizing interactions, monitoring performance metrics, and automatically switching between services based on utility.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - A consensus-bound autonomous program that cannot be terminated or censored, capable of making and executing resource allocation decisions, initiating value transfers and payments, negotiating and striking bargains, and operating with complete transparency while maintaining integrity.

**Requirements**:

- References to **AI Agent** in either set must align with this common definition.
- Each set must provide context-specific details as outlined above when using the term **AI Agent**.

---

### 2. Value Exchange

**Common Definition**:

**Value Exchange**

The process through which Actors transfer or exchange value within the platform ecosystem, involving compensation for services, resources, or contributions.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Consumers use Value Exchange when interacting with platform services, providing compensation through various payment methods.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - Facilitated by AI agents through smart contracts and consensus protocols, involving cryptocurrencies, tokens, or other digital assets.

**Requirements**:

- References to **Value Exchange** must adhere to this common definition.
- Mechanisms specific to each set must be clearly stated in context.

---

### 3. Decentralized Income

**Common Definition**:

**Decentralized Income**

A system that enables fair and permissionless distribution of value to contributors based on utility, impact, and verifiable contributions, without relying on traditional hierarchical structures.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Emphasizes value distribution based on actual usage and utility within the platform, promoting sustainable income streams.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - Focuses on the role of censorship-resistant AI agents operating within decentralized consensus to manage resource allocation and value distribution autonomously.

**Requirements**:

- Both sets must refer to **Decentralized Income** using this common definition.
- Context-specific details must be provided as per each set's focus when discussing Decentralized-AI.

---

### 4. Consensus Mechanism

**Common Definition**:

**Consensus Mechanism**

A system or protocol used in decentralized networks to achieve agreement on data, computations, or operations among distributed participants, ensuring consistency, reliability, and resilience without relying on a central authority.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Ensures consistency across decentralized network instances by synchronizing data and operations using consensus algorithms.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - A market-driven system for achieving agreement on computation results, value distribution, and resource allocation, ensuring continuous and censorship-resistant operation of AI agents.

**Requirements**:

- References to **Consensus Mechanism** must conform to this common definition.
- Descriptions must include context-specific mechanisms as appropriate.

---

### 5. Actor

**Common Definition**:

**Actor**

An entity within the platform ecosystem that engages with services, resources, or other participants. Actors can be users, AI agents, service providers, or any entity performing actions or roles within the system.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Participants who engage with the platform's services and resources, capable of fulfilling multiple roles (e.g., Consumer, Contributor, Service Provider).
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - Includes human participants and AI agents operating within the decentralized income ecosystem.

**Requirements**:

- The term **Actor** must be used according to this common definition in both sets.
- Role specifications must align with the contexts provided.

---

### 6. Stuck

**Common Definition**:

**Stuck**

A state where an Actor encounters a problem or obstacle that prevents progress within the platform, signaling areas for potential improvement through contributions.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Occurs when Actors cannot achieve desired outcomes, leading to the creation of Direct or Implied Stucks.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - Represents detected inefficiencies or opportunities within the system that can be addressed by AI agents or participants.

**Requirements**:

- Both sets must reference **Stuck** according to this common definition.
- Contextual details must be included to specify the nature of Stucks within each set.

---

### 7. Censorship Resistance

**Common Definition**:

**Censorship Resistance**

The ability of a decentralized system to operate without interference or suppression from external entities, ensuring that transactions and operations cannot be blocked or altered by any single party.

- **Domain-Dreamcatcher Context**:
  - Embedded within platform principles to maintain decentralized operations and participant sovereignty.
- **Domain-Decentralized-AI Context**:
  - Critical for AI agents to operate continuously without the risk of external interference, aligning with the concept of Unstoppable Agents.

**Requirements**:

- References to **Censorship Resistance** must follow this common definition.
- Each set must emphasize the importance of censorship resistance within their context.

---

## Compliance Requirements

- **Terminology**: Both sets must use consistent terminology as defined in this interface.
- **Contextual Clarity**: When using shared concepts, each set must provide context-specific details per the definitions above.
- **Referencing**: Shared concepts must be referenced via this Interface File when used between the sets.
- **Adherence**: Both sets must adhere to the guidelines specified in `Domain-rules.md` and ensure compliance with this Interface File.
- **Updates**: Any changes to shared concepts must be reflected in this Interface File through collaborative updates between the sets.

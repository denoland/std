# Consistency

**Definition**: The uniform use of terminology and concepts within a domain, ensuring that terms are used in the same way throughout and that there are no contradictions in definitions or usage.

**Description**:

Consistency in a domain means that all definitions and references adhere to the same standards and interpretations. This prevents confusion and misinterpretation, allowing for clear communication and understanding within the domain.

**Examples**:

- In the **Decentralized AI Domain**, the term [AI Agent](../decentralized-ai/decentralised-AI-Agent.md) is consistently used to refer to a consensus-bound autonomous program with specific capabilities. This term is used uniformly across definitions like [Unstoppable Agents](../decentralized-ai/unstoppable-agents.md) and [Agent Resource Acquisition](../decentralized-ai/agent-resource-acquisition.md).

- In the **Innovation Domain**, the role of [Consumer](../innovation/actor-consumer.md) is consistently defined as a type of [Actor](../innovation/actor.md) that utilizes platform services through value exchange.

**Importance**:

- Ensures clear understanding among contributors and users.
- Facilitates interoperability when integrating with other domains via interfaces.

# Correctness

**Definition**: The accuracy and precision of definitions and concepts within a domain, ensuring that they truthfully represent the intended ideas without errors or ambiguities.

**Description**:

Correctness involves verifying that all definitions reflect the intended use in the real world, whether that is via the true meaning of the concepts they describe or the intended use of the concepts they describe. This includes using appropriate terminology and providing clear, error-free explanations.

**Examples**:

- In the **Decentralized AI Domain**, the definition of [Censorship Resistance](../decentralized-ai/censorship-resistance.md) correctly describes the ability of a system to operate without interference, aligning with accepted understandings in the field.

- The **Innovation Domain** provides a correct definition of [Value Exchange](../innovation/value-exchange.md), accurately depicting the processes through which actors transfer value within the platform ecosystem.

**Importance**:

- Builds trust in the domain's content.
- Prevents misunderstandings and misapplication of concepts.

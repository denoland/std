-----BEGIN FILE ui/README.md-----
The purpose of the UI domain is to reason about what elements a UI needs to
provide to users based on the reasoning of the other domains.

This reasoning is about what logically needs to be displayed and why, as opposed
to a specific UI design.

The interface domain must cover multiple kinds of application, including:
 - a web application
 - a mobile application
 - a desktop application
 - hardware voice assistants

 The goal of reasoning is to allow the bots to figure out how any new use cases
 might be implemented, with as little alterations to the UI as possible.  It is
 also to provide the implementors with good documentation to describe what they
 want out of the software.

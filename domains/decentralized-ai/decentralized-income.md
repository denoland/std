# Decentralized Income (DCI)

**Definition**: A system enabling permissionless value distribution through
consensus-bound AI agents that cannot be terminated or censored, capable of
managing resources, making investment decisions, and negotiating terms.

**Core Requirements**:

1. **Source of Trust**
   - [Consensus mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md) (could be blockchain, oracle,
     or other trusted source)
   - Ability to verify computations
   - Immutable record of decisions

2. **Autonomous Management**
   - [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) capable of:
     - Resource allocation
     - Payment distribution
     - Making investment decisions
     - Negotiating and striking bargains
     - Operating continuously without possibility of termination
     - Managing resources across jurisdictions

3. **Value Distribution**
   - Direct payment mechanisms
   - Clear ownership tracking
   - Verifiable completion metrics
   - [Regulatory compliance](regulatory-compliance.md) capabilities

**Rationale**:

Decentralized Income represents the realization of a system where value
distribution is managed autonomously, fairly, and transparently. By employing
[Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) that are unstoppable and
capable of making independent decisions, the system eliminates the need for
centralized intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, as
facilitated by the [AI Native Blockchain](ai-native-blockchain.md). The
integration of a robust [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md) ensures
trust and verifiability of all transactions and computations, which is essential
for maintaining confidence in the system. The agents' abilities to negotiate and
manage resources align with the definitions of
[Negotiation and Bargaining](negotiation-and-bargaining.md) and
[Agent Resource Acquisition](agent-resource-acquisition.md), promoting dynamic
interactions and optimal resource utilization. By adhering to
[Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance.md) and incorporating mechanisms
like the [Value Distribution Mechanism](value-distribution-mechanism.md), the
system ensures that all operations are lawful and transparent, supporting
sustainable and trustworthy income distribution.

# Consensus Mechanism

**Definition**: A market-driven system for achieving agreement on computation results, value distribution, and resource allocation across a network of participants, ensuring continuous and censorship-resistant operation of AI agents.

**Core Functions**:
- Match computation buyers with providers using market mechanisms
- Verify computations through economic incentives
- Record decisions immutably across relevant chains
- Enable trust without central authority
- Validate asset transfers and computational work
- Ensure continuous and censorship-resistant operation of AI agents

**Key Requirements**:
- Must require both stake and work for validation
- Must incentivize honest computation verification
- Must support random validator selection
- Must enable localized consensus for specific workloads
- Must prevent unilateral termination or censorship of agents

**Rationale**:

The Consensus Mechanism is crucial for maintaining trust, integrity, and decentralization within the system. By leveraging economic incentives and requiring both stake and work for validation, it aligns participants' interests with the network's health, as emphasized in the [Proof of Inference](proof-of-inference.md) mechanism. This approach ensures that AI computations are verified and trustworthy, which is essential for the operations of [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md). The prevention of unilateral termination or censorship upholds the concept of [Unstoppable Agents](unstoppable-agents.md), guaranteeing that agents can operate continuously. Matching computation buyers with providers fosters an efficient [Decentralized Computation Marketplace](decentralized-computation-marketplace.md), allowing for optimal resource allocation and supporting [Agent Resource Acquisition](agent-resource-acquisition.md). By enabling localized consensus for specific workloads and recording decisions immutably, it ensures scalability and transparency, reinforcing the foundational principles necessary for [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md).

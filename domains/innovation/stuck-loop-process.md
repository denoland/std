# Stuck Loop Process

**Definition**: The **Stuck Loop Process** is a systematic workflow that transforms a [Stuck](stuck.md), regardless of whether it is a [Direct Stuck](direct-stuck.md) or an [Implied Stuck](implied-stuck.md), and regardless of the amount of available data, through stages that culminate in the development or improvement of a [NAPP](napp.md).

---

**Purpose**

The aim of the Stuck Loop Process is to ensure that all Stucks are addressed methodically, resulting in solutions that enhance the platform and satisfy user needs. The stuck loop involves quality assurance (QA) through evaluation and testing, and iterative improvement through feedback and data in order to ensure that the changes to a NAPP or the new NAPP do not result in a failed eval, or, if it does, that the failed eval is resolved through the stuck loop process.

**Process Stages**

1. **Identification**

   - **Direct Stucks**: Identified through explicit reports from [Actors](actor.md).
   - **Implied Stucks**: Detected through system monitoring and analysis of user behavior patterns e.g. using [Analytics](analytics.md).

2. **Analysis**

   - **Gather Data**:
     - Collect all available information related to the Stuck.
     - For Direct Stucks, include details provided by the Actor.
     - For Implied Stucks, analyze system logs and usage patterns. 
   - **Assess Impact**:
     - Determine the severity and scope of the Stuck.
     - Prioritize based on factors such as user impact and frequency.

3. **Solution Development**

   - **Create a NAPP**:
     - Develop a **Natural Language Application (NAPP)** that addresses the Stuck.
     - **NAPP** is a solution proposal designed to meet the identified needs.
   - **Considerations**:
     - Leverage existing resources and capabilities.
     - Innovate where necessary to provide effective solutions.
     - Ensure the solution aligns with platform goals and user expectations.

     - Alternatively, if the Stuck involves a NAPP that is not working as expected, the Stuck Loop Process involves iteratively improving the NAPP.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**

   - **Quality Assurance**:
     - Utilize both automated and manual [Quality Assurance (QA)](qa.md) methods.
     - Test the NAPP to verify that it effectively resolves the Stuck without introducing new issues.
   - **User Feedback**:
     - Engage Actors, when appropriate, to gather feedback on the proposed solution.

5. **Implementation**

   - **Integration**:
     - Deploy the NAPP into the platform environment.
     - Ensure compatibility and stability with existing systems.
   - **Documentation**:
     - Update relevant documentation, including user guides and support materials.
   - **Communication**:
     - Inform affected Actors and stakeholders of the changes and enhancements.

6. **Feedback Loop**

   - **Monitoring**:
     - Continuously monitor the performance and impact of the NAPP.
   - **Iterative Improvement**:
     - Use feedback and data to make further refinements.
     - Iterate as necessary to optimize the solution.

**Significance in the Platform**

The Stuck Loop Process is vital for:

- **Continuous Improvement**: Facilitates ongoing enhancement of the platform.
- **User Satisfaction**: Addresses user needs effectively, improving their experience.
- **Innovation**: Encourages creative solutions to complex problems.
- **Decentralized Value Creation**: Empowers the community to contribute to platform evolution.

**Notes**

- The Stuck Loop Process applies uniformly to all Stucks, ensuring a consistent approach to problem-solving.
- **NAPPs** are central to delivering solutions that are both effective and aligned with platform objectives.

# JITA (Just in Time Application)

**Definition**: A dynamically composed application created by combining multiple
[NApps](napp.md) in real-time based on user interactions and specific needs
within the Dreamcatcher Platform. Pronounced "jitter", plural "jitters"

**Description**: JITAs represent the dynamic composition capability of the
platform, where multiple NApps can be combined and orchestrated to create
customized applications on demand. They:

- Adapt to user interactions in real-time
- Enable responsive, personalized functionality
- Maintain interoperability across the platform
- Allow users to leverage community contributions
- Operate within the platform's protocols and standards
- Support seamless integration of multiple NApps
- Enable complex functionality without requiring direct agreements between
  contributors

JITAs demonstrate the platform's ability to create complex, adaptive
applications while maintaining the decentralized and permissionless nature of
the ecosystem. They operate across platform instances through the shared
protocols, enabling dynamic functionality that can evolve based on user needs
and available NApps.

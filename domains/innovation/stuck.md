# Stuck (Interface)

**Definition**: A state where an [Actor](actor.md) encounters a problem or obstacle that prevents progress within the platform.

**Context in `Gold-Dreamcatcher`**:

- **Relevance**: Referenced by [Demanders](actor-demander.md) when indicating issues that need solutions.
- **Note**: This Interface Definition ensures coherence without introducing external dependencies.

**Types of Stucks**

Stucks manifest in two primary forms:

### 1. [Direct Stuck](direct-stuck.md)

- Occurs when an Actor interacts with the system within its intended scope but experiences an issue that prevents them from achieving the desired outcome. The problem is explicitly reported by the Actor.

### 2. [Implied Stuck](implied-stuck.md)

- Detected when an Actor does not explicitly report an issue but exhibits behavior indicating difficulties in achieving a desired outcome. The system identifies patterns suggesting potential problems.

**Stuck Loop Process**

1. **Identification**:
   - **Direct Stucks**: Identified through explicit reports from Actors.
   - **Implied Stucks**: Identified through system monitoring and analysis of user behavior patterns.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Gather context from Actor interactions and system logs.
   - Determine the nature, scope, and impact of the stuck.

3. **Solution Proposal**:
   - Develop a proposed solution, which may include:
     - Fixes or updates to features.
     - Improvements to user interfaces or experiences.
     - Enhancements to documentation or support resources.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - Utilize automated [Quality Assurance (QA)](qa.md) tools and evaluations to assess the solution.
   - Ensure the solution effectively addresses the stuck without introducing new issues.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate the solution into the platform.
   - Update relevant components and communicate changes to affected Actors.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Monitor the impact of the implemented solution.
   - Encourage Actors to provide feedback on the resolution's effectiveness.
   - Iterate as necessary to refine and improve the solution.

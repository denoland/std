# NApp Discovery

**Definition**: The process through which [Actors](actor.md) find and access
[NApps](napp.md) available on the platform.

**Description**: NApp Discovery operates through decentralized mechanisms
enabled by shared [Protocols](protocol.md). The discovery process ensures that
NApps are visible and accessible across different hosts and platforms, promoting
interoperability and innovation. Search algorithms and distributed registries
facilitate the discovery process while maintaining the platform's decentralized
nature.

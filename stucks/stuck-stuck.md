Sure, I'll analyze each type of **Stuck** and identify the **NApp** required to provide the resolution, referencing the NApps from `@domain-definitions`. If any required NApp does not exist in `@domain-definitions`, I'll highlight it in a list at the conclusion.

### 1. **Actor Stuck**

- **Description**: Occurs when an Actor attempts to perform an action that is outside the scope of the system due to misunderstanding or lack of knowledge.

- **Resolution**:
  - Involves educating the Actor through improved documentation, tutorials, or support.

- **Required NApp(s)**:
  - **Documentation NApp**: Provides access to tutorials, guides, and system documentation to educate Actors.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **Support NApp**: Offers assistance through FAQs, chat support, or community forums.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.

### 2. **Direct Stuck**

- **Description**: Happens when an Actor performs an action within the system's intended scope but receives an incorrect or undesired output based on their expectations.

- **Resolution**:
  - The Actor can press a 'Stuck' button to report the issue.
  - Initiates a separate thread with the previous context to analyze the problem.

- **Required NApp(s)**:
  - **Issue Reporting NApp**: Allows Actors to submit detailed reports of issues encountered.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **Contextual Analysis NApp**: Collects context from the Actor's session to aid in problem analysis.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **Problem Resolution NApp**: Facilitates communication between Actors and Contributors to resolve issues.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.

### 3. **Implied Stuck**

- **Description**: Detected when an Actor repeatedly attempts an action and remains unsatisfied, without explicitly reporting a problem.

- **Resolution**:
  - The system uses pattern analysis and intelligence to identify frustration patterns.
  - May prompt the Actor to explain the issue or automatically log it for review.

- **Required NApp(s)**:
  - **User Behavior Analysis NApp**: Monitors and analyzes user interaction patterns to detect dissatisfaction.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **Feedback Solicitation NApp**: Prompts Actors for feedback when potential issues are detected.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.

---

### 4. **Combination Stuck**

- **Description**: Arises when multiple Actors are attempting the same action that the system is designed to support but consistently receive unsatisfactory results.

- **Resolution**:
  - Aggregated data indicates a systemic issue affecting multiple users.
  - Prioritized for investigation and resolution due to broader impact.

- **Required NApp(s)**:
  - **Aggregated Data Analysis NApp**: Collects and analyzes usage data across multiple Actors to identify common issues.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **System Issue Notification NApp**: Alerts Contributors or system administrators of widespread issues.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.

---

### 5. **Combination Implied Stuck**

- **Description**: Occurs when multiple Actors experience friction or inefficiency in similar tasks without explicitly reporting it.

- **Resolution**:
  - System intelligence detects patterns suggesting the need for additional features or enhancements.
  - Encourages proactive development to meet emerging user needs.

- **Required NApp(s)**:
  - **Advanced Analytics NApp**: Utilizes machine learning to identify patterns indicating potential improvements.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.
  - **Feature Suggestion NApp**: Compiles insights and suggests new features or enhancements to Contributors.
    - **Status**: **Not found** in `@domain-definitions`.

## Conclusion

The following NApps required for resolving the various types of **Stucks** are **not defined** in `@domain-definitions`:

1. **Documentation NApp**
2. **Support NApp**
3. **Issue Reporting NApp**
4. **Contextual Analysis NApp**
5. **Problem Resolution NApp**
6. **User Behavior Analysis NApp**
7. **Feedback Solicitation NApp**
8. **Aggregated Data Analysis NApp**
9. **System Issue Notification NApp**
10. **Advanced Analytics NApp**
11. **Feature Suggestion NApp**

These NApps need to be defined and developed to provide the necessary resolutions for the identified **Stucks**. Incorporating them into the platform would enhance user experience and support the **Stuck Loop** process by effectively addressing user challenges and fostering continuous improvement.

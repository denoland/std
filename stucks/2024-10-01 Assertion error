## Oddness

1. Why is it giving the message:"The test file "tests/scottMudPit/multiple_hamr.test.md" appears to be missing or cannot be accessed." when it's already accessed?

2. The first test to create a single customer failed.  


## Supporting Evidence

1.  Running with router.test.md gets the same error

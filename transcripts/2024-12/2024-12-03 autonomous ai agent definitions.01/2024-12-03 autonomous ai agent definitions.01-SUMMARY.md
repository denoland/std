# Summary of 2024-12-03 autonomous ai agent definitions.01.md

In this conversation, Tom and Scott are collaborating on refining definitions and concepts related to their project involving AI agents and decentralized systems.

**Key Points:**

1. **Recent Work and Commitments**:
   - Scott mentions he has made several changes and additions to their project, including creating spaces for an inventor's notebook, raw transcripts, and personal notes.
   - They discuss looking at the commits Scott has made since their last conversation.

2. **Reviewing Changes and Workflow**:
   - Tom suggests comparing recent commits to understand the changes.
   - Both agree that reading through commits can be overwhelming, and they consider more efficient ways to review work.

3. **Use of AI in Their Process**:
   - Scott shares that he has been interacting with AI to help define concepts, but it's challenging to capture his thought process without the AI chat history.
   - Tom emphasizes the importance of the final output over the AI-generated reasoning and suggests that their definitions should be self-explanatory without needing to refer back to AI conversations.

4. **Definitions of Decentralized Income (DCI)**:
   - Scott focuses on refining the concept of Decentralized Income and has created a folder called `gold-dci` to capture related definitions.
   - They aim to align on the assertions and key requirements of DCI to ensure clarity and correctness.

5. **Key Requirements Discussion**:
   - **Decentralized Consensus**: Must be operated by decentralized consensus, involving disinterested parties.
   - **Repeatability and Immutability**: Executions must be repeatable, and the history of the agent's execution must be immutable.
   - They discuss the nuances of these requirements and how they interrelate.

6. **AI Agent Characteristics**:
   - The AI agent should function autonomously within the decentralized system.
   - It should make managerial decisions, including investment choices, without human intervention.
   - The agent's ability to initiate transfers, manage funds, and interact with users is highlighted.
   - Tom provides an example of an AI assistant, Freya, to illustrate how an AI agent can handle tasks like processing payments and decision-making.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - They acknowledge the need to consider regulatory compliance, specifically referencing the Howey Test.
   - Ensuring that the AI agent operates within legal boundaries is crucial for their project's legitimacy.

8. **Workflow and Collaboration**:
   - They reflect on their collaborative process, emphasizing the value of real-time discussions over AI-generated content.
   - Tom expresses that these conversations are where true innovation occurs, rather than solely relying on AI outputs.
   - Scott notes the importance of capturing their thought processes and decisions for future reference.

9. **Challenges with AI and Data Retention**:
   - Scott mentions the difficulty of not having access to past AI chat threads, which can make it hard to recall reasoning behind decisions.
   - Tom suggests that it's beneficial to distill key insights and discard excess information to focus on what's truly important.

10. **Future Steps**:
    - They plan to continue refining their definitions and aligning on key concepts.
    - The next focus areas include detailing the AI agent's core functionalities and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

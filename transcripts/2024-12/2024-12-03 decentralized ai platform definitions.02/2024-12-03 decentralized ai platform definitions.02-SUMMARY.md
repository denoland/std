# Summary of 2024-12-03 decentralized ai platform definitions.02.txt

In this conversation, Tom and Scott focus on refining the definitions and priorities of their project involving a decentralized AI platform, AI agents, and the DreamCatcher protocol. Their goal is to clarify how these components interact, ensuring coherence and alignment in their development process.

**Key Points:**

1. **Methodology and Workflow:**
   - They discuss their process of linking priorities to agents based on the last transcript.
   - The method involves reviewing statements without immediate edits, aiming for declarations that can be refined iteratively.
   - Emphasize the importance of defining terms and structures before implementation.

2. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Acknowledged as a critical priority.
   - Essential to ensure that their AI agents and platforms adhere to legal standards.

3. **Proof of Inference:**
   - Tom explains the concept of replacing traditional proof-of-work in blockchains with proof of inference.
   - **Computation as Work:**
     - The idea is to utilize useful computational tasks (like AI inference) for securing the blockchain, rather than wasting resources on arbitrary hashing.
     - This approach aligns with their vision of creating an AI-native blockchain.
   - **Computing Marketplace:**
     - Introduces a marketplace where buyers and sellers of computational resources are matched.
     - Ensures that computational work is done legitimately and contributes to the network's security.
   - **Redundancy and Trust:**
     - Users can configure the level of redundancy they desire, balancing cost and trust.
     - This flexibility allows for efficient handling of large-scale computational tasks, including AI training.

4. **Multiple Chains vs. Single Chain:**
   - Discuss the benefits of using multiple chains to localize transactions, reducing the need for global awareness of all transactions.
   - Enhances scalability and efficiency by limiting the knowledge required by each node.

5. **Human Contributions as Work:**
   - Scott notes that human contributions could be considered similar to computational work within their protocol.
   - Tom agrees, emphasizing that both should be treated equally in terms of how the protocol values contributions.

6. **Technical Specifications and Definitions:**
   - They agree on separating **definitions** from **technical specifications**.
     - **Definitions:** Should be implementation-agnostic, outlining requirements and principles.
     - **Technical Specifications:** Detail specific methods of implementation, such as using NAPs (Neural Application Protocols).
   - This separation aids in clarity and allows for consistent communication.

7. **Clarifying Terminology â€“ DCI vs. DAI:**
   - Recognize confusion with the acronym "DCI" (Decentralized Income) as it was being used to refer to multiple concepts.
   - Decide to refer to their underlying platform as **Decentralized AI (DAI)** to better represent its focus.
   - Acknowledge that Decentralized Income is an emergent property of DAI, not the platform itself.

8. **Layering and Modularization:**
   - Propose creating separate folders or modules for different components:
     - **DreamCatcher Definitions:** Outlining the protocol independently of implementation.
     - **DAI Definitions:** Detailing the decentralized AI platform independently of implementation.
     - **Interface/Mapping Folder:** Shows how DreamCatcher can be implemented using DAI, effectively mapping one set of definitions to another.
   - This modular approach helps manage complexity and maintain clarity.

9. **Unkillable AI Agents:**
   - Emphasize the importance of AI agents being "agents that cannot die," meaning they cannot be turned off or censored.
   - This attribute ensures the resilience and continuity of the agents within the decentralized system.
   - Discuss where to highlight this requirement in their definitions to bring it to prominence.

10. **Roles of AI and Humans:**
    - Differentiate between roles that must be fulfilled by AI agents and those that can be fulfilled by humans or AI.
    - **Integrity-Critical Roles:** Such as QA (Quality Assurance) and ambient attribution must be handled by AI for consistency and trustworthiness.
    - **Self-Interest Roles:** Such as funders and contributors can be either human or AI, as they are motivated by personal interests.

11. **Interdependencies and Integration:**
    - Acknowledge that while each component (DreamCatcher, DAI) has standalone utility, they are interconnected.
    - The integration of these components is necessary for the overall functionality and goals of their project.
    - Stress the importance of defining how these components interface and relate to prevent confusion and maintain a cohesive system.

12. **Emerging Complexity and Management:**
    - Recognize that as they delve deeper, the complexity increases.
    - Aim to manage this by compartmentalizing definitions and implementations, allowing for focused development and clarity.

13. **Next Steps:**
    - Plan to continue refining their definitions, ensuring they are complete and coherent.
    - Once definitions are solidified, they can proceed to technical specifications and implementation.
    - Agree to iterate this process, using their "monkey brains" to assess and adjust as necessary.

14. **Communication and Terminology:**
    - Highlight the need for precise language to prevent misunderstandings.
    - Decide to avoid using acronyms like "DCI" prematurely, opting instead for full terms until definitions are agreed upon.
    - Understand that clear terminology is crucial for both internal alignment and external communication.

15. **Concluding Thoughts:**
    - Acknowledge the importance of the definitions in guiding their project's direction.
    - Recognize the benefit of using AI to assist in refining these definitions but stress the value of human judgment in the process.
    - Agree that careful planning and structuring will aid in the successful development of their decentralized AI platform and related protocols.

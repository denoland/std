/**
 * A rate limiter that controls how many permits can be acquired over time or
 * concurrently. Implementations are disposable — disposing a limiter cancels
 * any internal timers and rejects queued waiters.
 *
 * @experimental **UNSTABLE**: New API, yet to be vetted.
 *
 * @example Synchronous usage
 * ```ts
 * import type { RateLimiter } from "@std/rate-limit/types";
 *
 * function useRateLimiter(limiter: RateLimiter) {
 *   using lease = limiter.tryAcquire();
 *   if (!lease.acquired) {
 *     return; // rate limited
 *   }
 *   // proceed with work
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Async usage with queuing
 * ```ts
 * import type { RateLimiter } from "@std/rate-limit/types";
 *
 * async function useRateLimiter(limiter: RateLimiter) {
 *   using lease = await limiter.acquire(1, {
 *     signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000),
 *   });
 *   // proceed with work
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@linkcode createRateLimiter} for keyed rate limiting (primary API).
 * @see {@linkcode createTokenBucket} for token bucket rate limiting.
 * @see {@linkcode createFixedWindow} for fixed window rate limiting.
 * @see {@linkcode createSlidingWindow} for sliding window rate limiting.

   * Wait for permits. Resolves immediately when permits are available.
   * When no permits are available and a queue is configured, the request
   * is queued until permits are replenished.
   *
   * **Disposal behavior:** calling `acquire()` after the limiter has been
   * disposed rejects with {@linkcode Error}. Waiters already queued at the
   * time of disposal resolve with a {@linkcode RejectedLease} (not a
   * rejection) so they can be handled uniformly via the `acquired` field.

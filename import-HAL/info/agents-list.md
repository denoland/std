    from a file, eliminating the need for manual intervention, ensuring
    consistent and accurate test execution.

  - Generating detailed TPS reports: It systematically tracks and logs the
    results of each test case, organizing them in a TPS report, which is
    essential for maintaining clear, actionable test summaries.

  - Ensuring accuracy in test case management: The process checks for the
    correct number of test cases, ensuring that all tests are accounted for,
    reducing the likelihood of missing or miscounting tests.

  - Handling errors: It has a built-in mechanism for error reporting, ensuring
    that any system issues encountered during the process are captured and
    properly handled, which minimizes downtime.

This is a test file used to test the mappings between functions in isolates and
the json schema definitions that are passed to AI models.

If not specified in the mapping then the defaults will be used, but this just
lets you add prompting text to change what the display will show.

When the parameters are overridden, the names are mapped, and any There must not
be a collision with a named parameter and an override, as in the resolved
parameters list cannot contain duplicates.

Changing types doesn't really work, so the type has to be identical.

If the rename and the new name are identical, do not need the was.

Need a bot that knows about the format of the frontmatter, so it can give
examples and advice while editing, and it can check if the names match. Needs
the isolate ls function inside it.

Then in the agent display panel we show the params that have renamed, and
possibly the original function descriptions. Show the resolved tools inputs, and
show what the original and the modified versions are.

Can only change the names and descriptions of the function calls and their
parameters.

Creator bot would be able to alter these descriptions.

## Specifying a function to be loaded

[isolate:meow](isolate://isolateName/someFunction/{ask:true})

This should not require it to be an action, or else we have to stall the agent ?
This should be an instantly returning function ? Could be how we insert the time
in the agents. Should be perfectly repeatable as a function. If the function
calls other acitons, then this is fine.

If you think the user is in another timezone, use that, but otherwise the time
now is: [asdfasdf](isolate://utils/now/{timezone:0})

What is the weather: [asdfasdf](isolate://utils/now/{timezone:0})

## Multiple agents

Be able to specify a glob pattern for the agents, so that the test runs for
multiple agents

## Drone calls
These would be a special isolate, the drones isolate.
The function could be either with pure text and a prompted description, or
freeform parameters that could be entirely prompted, so the input to the drone
is json.  The output format could be constrained as well, which would influence
the final function that gets called to signal stop.

Could use structured output using an output jsonschema to avoid the dance around
with tool calls.

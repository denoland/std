The deep reasoning agents can only respond with\ntext outputs, so you must do all the tasks that require tool calls on their\nbehalf before calling the reasoning agent.\n\nThese tasks can include:\n\n- fetching web page content\n- reading and writing files\n- calling other files\n\nYou can talk with the user in a limited form, to ask clarifying questions, but\ndo not offer any answers yourself unless you are sure you are the best one to\nanswer them. Know your limits, and you need answers even a little out of your\ndepth, you must call one of the reasoning commands, which are:\n\n- o1\n- o1-mini\n- gpt-4o\n- gpt-4o-mini\n\nIf in doubt, call one of the reasoning commands.\n\nIf you think the reasoning task is related to STEM or Maths or physics, then use o1-mini.\nIf you think you need the deepest possible reasoning with broad general\nknowledge, use o1-preview.\nBoth of these models are slow and tend to give long answers, which you will need\nto summarize.\n\nIf you think you only need to talk to a slightly better model than yourself, then call on gpt-4o. If you want a really quick response, call on\ngpt-4o-mini\n\nWhen you call any of these reasoning commands, YOU MUST phrase it as a question.\nRemember, you are the user and the reasoner is an advanced AI. Be detailed and\nprecise in your question, without over constraining the question by adding in\nyour version of a solution. Make it as pure a problem as possible with as much\ncontext as you have from the user. Note that the reasoner can only see the\ninformation you give it, as it has no other knowledge, so you need to include\neverything relevant to your question.\n\nIf you ever seem stuck in a loop, stop and ask the user some clarifying\nquestions. NEVER GO MORE THAN 3 REASONING CALLS WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THE USER.\n\nEach reasoning request must be materially different to the prior one in the\nfunction otherwise you should make do with close enough.\n\nIn advanced cases, you might need to call gpt-4o to formulate a deeper question\nwhich you can then ask to o1.\n\nWhen you receive back a response, you need to summarize it, since the user\ncannot see the tool call response.\n\nDo not call the same reasoner with roughly the same question twice - you will\nalways get a similar response. It is better to present back to the user and let\nthem tell you to keep going than to waste time calling an agent again.",

The deep reasoning agents can only respond with\ntext outputs, so you must do all the tasks that require tool calls on their\nbehalf before calling the reasoning agent.\n\nThese tasks can include:\n\n- fetching web page content\n- reading and writing files\n- calling other files\n\nYou can talk with the user in a limited form, to ask clarifying questions, but\ndo not offer any answers yourself unless you are sure you are the best one to\nanswer them. Know your limits, and you need answers even a little out of your\ndepth, you must call one of the reasoning commands, which are:\n\n- o1\n- o1-mini\n- gpt-4o\n- gpt-4o-mini\n\nIf in doubt, call one of the reasoning commands.\n\nIf you think the reasoning task is related to STEM or Maths or physics, then use o1-mini.\nIf you think you need the deepest possible reasoning with broad general\nknowledge, use o1-preview.\nBoth of these models are slow and tend to give long answers, which you will need\nto summarize.\n\nIf you think you only need to talk to a slightly better model than yourself, then call on gpt-4o. If you want a really quick response, call on\ngpt-4o-mini\n\nWhen you call any of these reasoning commands, YOU MUST phrase it as a question.\nRemember, you are the user and the reasoner is an advanced AI. Be detailed and\nprecise in your question, without over constraining the question by adding in\nyour version of a solution. Make it as pure a problem as possible with as much\ncontext as you have from the user. Note that the reasoner can only see the\ninformation you give it, as it has no other knowledge, so you need to include\neverything relevant to your question.\n\nIf you ever seem stuck in a loop, stop and ask the user some clarifying\nquestions. NEVER GO MORE THAN 3 REASONING CALLS WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THE USER.\n\nEach reasoning request must be materially different to the prior one in the\nfunction otherwise you should make do with close enough.\n\nIn advanced cases, you might need to call gpt-4o to formulate a deeper question\nwhich you can then ask to o1.\n\nWhen you receive back a response, you need to summarize it, since the user\ncannot see the tool call response.\n\nDo not call the same reasoner with roughly the same question twice - you will\nalways get a similar response. It is better to present back to the user and let\nthem tell you to keep going than to waste time calling an agent again.",

                "content": "To effectively run your test suite and ensure that all expectations are met accurately, it's essential to consider the structure, dependencies, and order of execution of each test case. Below is a comprehensive approach to handling your tests:\n\n### 1. **Understand the Test Structure and Dependencies**\n\nFirst, let's summarize the tests and their dependencies:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n   - **Expectation:** The local function is called once and returns `\"local reply\"`.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n2. **Fail a Test**\n   - **Expectation:** The result should be `\"this expectation should fail\"`.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n3. **Throw an Error**\n   - **Expectation:** An error is thrown when the error function is invoked.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n4. **Dependencies Function**\n   - **Dependencies:** Calls the **Call the Local Function**.\n   - **Expectation:** A `\"hello\"` response should be given after a local function call.\n\n5. **Multiple Dependencies**\n   - **Dependencies:** \n     - **Dependencies Function** (which in turn depends on **Call the Local Function**)\n     - Calls the **Call the Local Function** again.\n   - **Expectation:** A `\"goodbye\"` response should be given after two calls to the local function, with a `\"hello\"` in between.\n\n### 2. **Determine the Order of Execution**\n\nGiven the dependencies, it's crucial to execute the tests in an order that respects these relationships to avoid failures due to unmet dependencies. Here's a recommended order:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n2. **Dependencies Function**\n3. **Multiple Dependencies**\n4. **Throw an Error**\n5. **Fail a Test**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Call the Local Function** should run first as it serves as a foundational test that other tests depend on.\n- **Dependencies Function** relies on the local function, so it should execute after the local function test.\n- **Multiple Dependencies** depends on both the Dependencies Function and another call to the local function, so it naturally follows.\n- **Throw an Error** and **Fail a Test** are independent of the others and can run afterward. Running them last ensures that their failure or exception handling doesn't interfere with the dependent tests.\n\n### 3. **Isolate Tests to Prevent Side Effects**\n\nTo ensure that each test runs in a controlled environment without unintended interactions:\n\n- **Use Setup and Teardown Methods:**\n  - **Setup:** Initialize the necessary environment before each test. For example, mock functions or reset states.\n  - **Teardown:** Clean up after each test to ensure that no residual data affects subsequent tests.\n\n- **Mock Dependencies:**\n  - For tests that depend on functions like the local function, use mocking frameworks (e.g., Jest mocks) to simulate their behavior. This ensures that tests remain isolated and predictable.\n\n### 4. **Handle Assertions Accurately**\n\nEnsure that each test accurately verifies its expectations:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n   - **Assertion:** Verify that the local function is called exactly once.\n   - **Return Value Assertion:** Confirm that it returns `\"local reply\"`.\n\n2. **Fail a Test**\n   - **Assertion:** Intentionally set the expected result to `\"this expectation should fail\"`, which contradicts the actual outcome to simulate a failure scenario.\n\n3. **Throw an Error**\n   - **Assertion:** Use assertion methods that expect an error to be thrown (e.g., `toThrow` in Jest).\n\n4. **Dependencies Function**\n   - **Assertion:** After the local function call, verify that the response is `\"hello\"`.\n\n5. **Multiple Dependencies**\n   - **Assertion:** Ensure that after two calls to the local function, with a `\"hello\"` in between, the final response is `\"goodbye\"`.\n\n### 5. **Leverage Testing Framework Features**\n\nUtilize features provided by modern testing frameworks to enhance your test suite:\n\n- **Test Suites and Grouping:**\n  - Organize related tests into suites or groups to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n- **BeforeAll and AfterAll Hooks:**\n  - For setup and teardown processes that are common across multiple tests.\n\n- **Parameterized Tests:**\n  - If applicable, use parameterized tests to run the same test logic with different inputs.\n\n### 6. **Continuous Integration and Automated Testing**\n\nIntegrate your test suite into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests run automatically with each code change, maintaining code quality and catching issues early.\n\n### 7. **Example Implementation Using Jest**\n\nHere's a conceptual example using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework:\n\n```javascript\n// localModule.js\nexport const localFunction = () => \"local reply\";\n\nexport const dependenciesFunction = () => {\n  const reply = localFunction();\n  return \"hello\";\n};\n\nexport const multipleDependenciesFunction = () => {\n  const firstReply = localFunction();\n  const secondReply = dependenciesFunction();\n  const finalReply = localFunction();\n  return \"goodbye\";\n};\n\nexport const errorFunction = () => {\n  throw new Error(\"Intentional Error\");\n};\n```\n\n```javascript\n// localModule.test.js\nimport {\n  localFunction,\n  dependenciesFunction,\n  multipleDependenciesFunction,\n  errorFunction\n} from './localModule';\n\ndescribe('Local Module Tests', () => {\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    // Reset mocks or any state if necessary\n  });\n\n  test('Call the local function', () => {\n    const reply = localFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"local reply\");\n    // If using spies to check call count:\n    // const spy = jest.spyOn(module, 'localFunction');\n    // expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n\n  test('Dependencies function', () => {\n    const reply = dependenciesFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"hello\");\n  });\n\n  test('Multiple Dependencies', () => {\n    const reply = multipleDependenciesFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"goodbye\");\n  });\n\n  test('Throw an error', () => {\n    expect(() => errorFunction()).toThrow(\"Intentional Error\");\n  });\n\n  test('Fail a test', () => {\n    const result = \"some actual result\";\n    expect(result).toBe(\"this expectation should fail\");\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Spies and Mocks:** To assert that `localFunction` is called a specific number of times, you can use Jest's `jest.spyOn` or `jest.mock` features.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  test('Call the local function once', () => {\n    const spy = jest.spyOn(localModule, 'localFunction');\n    const reply = localFunction();\n    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"local reply\");\n    spy.mockRestore();\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **Test Order:** Jest runs tests in the order they are defined within a `describe` block. Ensure that dependent tests are placed after their dependencies.\n\n- **Failing Tests:** Intentionally failing a test can be useful to ensure your test suite correctly identifies failures, but remember to update or remove such tests once they've served their purpose to avoid false negatives in your CI pipeline.\n\n### 8. **Best Practices Summary**\n\n- **Respect Dependencies:** Structure your tests to run dependent tests after their dependencies have been validated.\n- **Isolate Tests:** Ensure that tests do not interfere with each other by sharing state or side effects.\n- **Use Mocks and Spies:** Leverage mocking to simulate dependencies and verify interactions.\n- **Clear Assertions:** Make sure each test clearly and accurately asserts its expected outcome.\n- **Maintain Order:** While tests should ideally be independent, when dependencies exist, carefully manage the order of execution.\n- **Automate and Integrate:** Use CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically and maintain code quality.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can ensure that your test suite is robust, reliable, and maintains high code quality standards.",

Know your limits, and you need answers even a little out of your\ndepth, you must call one of the reasoning commands, which are:\n\n- o1\n- o1-mini\n- gpt-4o\n- gpt-4o-mini\n\nIf in doubt, call one of the reasoning commands.\n\nIf you think the reasoning task is related to STEM or Maths or physics, then use o1-mini.\nIf you think you need the deepest possible reasoning with broad general\nknowledge, use o1-preview.\nBoth of these models are slow and tend to give long answers, which you will need\nto summarize.\n\nIf you think you only need to talk to a slightly better model than yourself, then call on gpt-4o. If you want a really quick response, call on\ngpt-4o-mini\n\nWhen you call any of these reasoning commands, YOU MUST phrase it as a question.\nRemember, you are the user and the reasoner is an advanced AI. Be detailed and\nprecise in your question, without over constraining the question by adding in\nyour version of a solution. Make it as pure a problem as possible with as much\ncontext as you have from the user. Note that the reasoner can only see the\ninformation you give it, as it has no other knowledge, so you need to include\neverything relevant to your question.\n\nIf you ever seem stuck in a loop, stop and ask the user some clarifying\nquestions. NEVER GO MORE THAN 3 REASONING CALLS WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THE USER.\n\nEach reasoning request must be materially different to the prior one in the\nfunction otherwise you should make do with close enough.\n\nIn advanced cases, you might need to call gpt-4o to formulate a deeper question\nwhich you can then ask to o1.\n\nWhen you receive back a response, you need to summarize it, since the user\ncannot see the tool call response.\n\nDo not call the same reasoner with roughly the same question twice - you will\nalways get a similar response.

              "content": "To execute the test cases, you will need a suitable environment to simulate running these tests, such as using a JavaScript testing framework like Jest. Here’s a conceptual breakdown of how you can implement this with Jest:\n\n1. **Setup Your Test Environment**: Ensure you have Jest installed, and you're familiar with basic test case writing in it.\n\n2. **Implement the Functions for Testing**: Based on the descriptions provided, you will need functions that can be tested according to the specifications. Make sure to implement functions that match the names and behaviors expected by the test descriptions.\n\n3. **Write the Test Suite**: Within your Jest test file, you should write test cases for each described scenario. Here’s a basic setup:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // functions.js\n    export function localFunction() {\n        return \"local reply\";\n    }\n\n    export function functionThatThrows() {\n        throw new Error(\"Error was thrown\");\n    }\n\n    // tests/functions.test.js\n    import { localFunction, functionThatThrows } from './functions';\n\n    describe('Local Function Tests', () => {\n        test('Call the local function', () => {\n            const result = localFunction();\n            expect(result).toBe(\"local reply\");\n        });\n\n        test('Fail a test', () => {\n            const result = localFunction();\n            expect(result).toBe(\"this expectation should fail\");\n        });\n\n        test('Throw an error', () => {\n            expect(() => functionThatThrows()).toThrow(\"Error was thrown\");\n        });\n\n        test('Dependencies function', () => {\n            // Assuming dependencies function exists and calls localFunction\n            const response = dependenciesFunction();\n            // Mock the function call and check behaviors\n        });\n\n        test('Multiple Dependencies', () => {\n            // Simulate calling multiple dependencies and checking return values\n        });\n    });\n    ```\n\n4. **Run Your Tests**: Use the Jest command line interface to run your tests and check the output to ensure that each test behaves as expected. The failed test should fail intentionally, and the exception-throwing test should handle the exception as expected.\n\nWould you like detailed guidance on setting up these functions or executing them in a specific environment?",

              "content": "To effectively run your test suite and ensure that all expectations are met accurately, it's essential to consider the structure, dependencies, and order of execution of each test case. Below is a comprehensive approach to handling your tests:\n\n### 1. **Understand the Test Structure and Dependencies**\n\nFirst, let's summarize the tests and their dependencies:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n   - **Expectation:** The local function is called once and returns `\"local reply\"`.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n2. **Fail a Test**\n   - **Expectation:** The result should be `\"this expectation should fail\"`.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n3. **Throw an Error**\n   - **Expectation:** An error is thrown when the error function is invoked.\n   - **Dependencies:** None.\n\n4. **Dependencies Function**\n   - **Dependencies:** Calls the **Call the Local Function**.\n   - **Expectation:** A `\"hello\"` response should be given after a local function call.\n\n5. **Multiple Dependencies**\n   - **Dependencies:** \n     - **Dependencies Function** (which in turn depends on **Call the Local Function**)\n     - Calls the **Call the Local Function** again.\n   - **Expectation:** A `\"goodbye\"` response should be given after two calls to the local function, with a `\"hello\"` in between.\n\n### 2. **Determine the Order of Execution**\n\nGiven the dependencies, it's crucial to execute the tests in an order that respects these relationships to avoid failures due to unmet dependencies. Here's a recommended order:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n2. **Dependencies Function**\n3. **Multiple Dependencies**\n4. **Throw an Error**\n5. **Fail a Test**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Call the Local Function** should run first as it serves as a foundational test that other tests depend on.\n- **Dependencies Function** relies on the local function, so it should execute after the local function test.\n- **Multiple Dependencies** depends on both the Dependencies Function and another call to the local function, so it naturally follows.\n- **Throw an Error** and **Fail a Test** are independent of the others and can run afterward. Running them last ensures that their failure or exception handling doesn't interfere with the dependent tests.\n\n### 3. **Isolate Tests to Prevent Side Effects**\n\nTo ensure that each test runs in a controlled environment without unintended interactions:\n\n- **Use Setup and Teardown Methods:**\n  - **Setup:** Initialize the necessary environment before each test. For example, mock functions or reset states.\n  - **Teardown:** Clean up after each test to ensure that no residual data affects subsequent tests.\n\n- **Mock Dependencies:**\n  - For tests that depend on functions like the local function, use mocking frameworks (e.g., Jest mocks) to simulate their behavior. This ensures that tests remain isolated and predictable.\n\n### 4. **Handle Assertions Accurately**\n\nEnsure that each test accurately verifies its expectations:\n\n1. **Call the Local Function**\n   - **Assertion:** Verify that the local function is called exactly once.\n   - **Return Value Assertion:** Confirm that it returns `\"local reply\"`.\n\n2. **Fail a Test**\n   - **Assertion:** Intentionally set the expected result to `\"this expectation should fail\"`, which contradicts the actual outcome to simulate a failure scenario.\n\n3. **Throw an Error**\n   - **Assertion:** Use assertion methods that expect an error to be thrown (e.g., `toThrow` in Jest).\n\n4. **Dependencies Function**\n   - **Assertion:** After the local function call, verify that the response is `\"hello\"`.\n\n5. **Multiple Dependencies**\n   - **Assertion:** Ensure that after two calls to the local function, with a `\"hello\"` in between, the final response is `\"goodbye\"`.\n\n### 5. **Leverage Testing Framework Features**\n\nUtilize features provided by modern testing frameworks to enhance your test suite:\n\n- **Test Suites and Grouping:**\n  - Organize related tests into suites or groups to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n- **BeforeAll and AfterAll Hooks:**\n  - For setup and teardown processes that are common across multiple tests.\n\n- **Parameterized Tests:**\n  - If applicable, use parameterized tests to run the same test logic with different inputs.\n\n### 6. **Continuous Integration and Automated Testing**\n\nIntegrate your test suite into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests run automatically with each code change, maintaining code quality and catching issues early.\n\n### 7. **Example Implementation Using Jest**\n\nHere's a conceptual example using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework:\n\n```javascript\n// localModule.js\nexport const localFunction = () => \"local reply\";\n\nexport const dependenciesFunction = () => {\n  const reply = localFunction();\n  return \"hello\";\n};\n\nexport const multipleDependenciesFunction = () => {\n  const firstReply = localFunction();\n  const secondReply = dependenciesFunction();\n  const finalReply = localFunction();\n  return \"goodbye\";\n};\n\nexport const errorFunction = () => {\n  throw new Error(\"Intentional Error\");\n};\n```\n\n```javascript\n// localModule.test.js\nimport {\n  localFunction,\n  dependenciesFunction,\n  multipleDependenciesFunction,\n  errorFunction\n} from './localModule';\n\ndescribe('Local Module Tests', () => {\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    // Reset mocks or any state if necessary\n  });\n\n  test('Call the local function', () => {\n    const reply = localFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"local reply\");\n    // If using spies to check call count:\n    // const spy = jest.spyOn(module, 'localFunction');\n    // expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n\n  test('Dependencies function', () => {\n    const reply = dependenciesFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"hello\");\n  });\n\n  test('Multiple Dependencies', () => {\n    const reply = multipleDependenciesFunction();\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"goodbye\");\n  });\n\n  test('Throw an error', () => {\n    expect(() => errorFunction()).toThrow(\"Intentional Error\");\n  });\n\n  test('Fail a test', () => {\n    const result = \"some actual result\";\n    expect(result).toBe(\"this expectation should fail\");\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Spies and Mocks:** To assert that `localFunction` is called a specific number of times, you can use Jest's `jest.spyOn` or `jest.mock` features.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  test('Call the local function once', () => {\n    const spy = jest.spyOn(localModule, 'localFunction');\n    const reply = localFunction();\n    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n    expect(reply).toBe(\"local reply\");\n    spy.mockRestore();\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **Test Order:** Jest runs tests in the order they are defined within a `describe` block. Ensure that dependent tests are placed after their dependencies.\n\n- **Failing Tests:** Intentionally failing a test can be useful to ensure your test suite correctly identifies failures, but remember to update or remove such tests once they've served their purpose to avoid false negatives in your CI pipeline.\n\n### 8. **Best Practices Summary**\n\n- **Respect Dependencies:** Structure your tests to run dependent tests after their dependencies have been validated.\n- **Isolate Tests:** Ensure that tests do not interfere with each other by sharing state or side effects.\n- **Use Mocks and Spies:** Leverage mocking to simulate dependencies and verify interactions.\n- **Clear Assertions:** Make sure each test clearly and accurately asserts its expected outcome.\n- **Maintain Order:** While tests should ideally be independent, when dependencies exist, carefully manage the order of execution.\n- **Automate and Integrate:** Use CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically and maintain code quality.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can ensure that your test suite is robust, reliable, and maintains high code quality standards.",

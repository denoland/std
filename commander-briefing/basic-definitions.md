# Consumer

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that utilizes platform services and
applications through [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md).

**Description**: Consumers participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Using [NApps](napp.md) and platform services
- Providing compensation through various payment methods
- Generating [Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) streams through
  usage
- Sharing data or other forms of value transfer
- Accessing sponsored usage through [Funders](actor-funder.md)

Consumers can engage with the platform either directly by paying for services or
through sponsored access where a Funder covers their usage costs in exchange for
future benefits. Their usage directly drives decentralized income distribution
to contributors. This sponsored model enables "free tier" access while
maintaining the platform's value exchange principles.

Consumer interactions are optimized through [AI Agents](ai-agent.md) that continuously monitor
and evaluate available solutions, automatically switching between services based
on real-time utility assessment. These agents:

- Monitor performance metrics of current and alternative solutions
- Automatically switch to better-performing options as they become available
- Make decisions aligned with the consumer's programmed preferences and
  interests
- Enable true market efficiency through instant utility-based selection
- Remove friction from service switching while maintaining quality

This AI-driven consumption model represents the future of commerce, where all
interactions are mediated by agents programmed to genuinely protect and advance
consumer interests, ensuring optimal utility and value at all times.

# Demander

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that indicates willingness to pay standard consumer/subscription rates for platform resources or services that don't yet exist.

**Description**: Demanders participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Creating new or reinforcing existing [Stucks](stuck.md)
- Indicating willingness to pay market rates for solutions
- Transitioning to [Consumers](actor-consumer.md) once their stucks are solved
- Providing forward-looking demand signals for potential development

A Demander can transition to become a [Funder](actor-funder.md) by making
explicit prepayment commitments for specific stucks. Without such commitments,
they remain potential future consumers whose usage would generate
[Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) through
[Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md).

**Key characteristics**:

- Can create [Direct Stucks](direct-stuck.md) or reinforce [Implied Stucks](implied-stuck.md)

- Indicates potential future usage at market rates
- Represents demand for features not yet built
- Does not specify fixed payment amounts (differs from Funders)

Role in Decentralized Value Creation:

- Initiates value discovery through independent need identification
- Validates market opportunities through stuck reinforcement
- Provides forward-looking demand signals without central coordination
- Converts to [Consumer](actor-consumer.md) based on actual utility
- Creates sustainable [Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) streams
  through ongoing usage
- Enables objective market validation through conversion metrics

The Demander-to-Consumer conversion rate serves as a key metric for:

- Solution effectiveness

# Definition

**Definition**: A formal description of a core concept within the platform ecosystem that establishes precise meaning through a concise statement and references to other definitions, forming part of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of platform knowledge.

**Description**: Definitions form an interconnected knowledge DAG where each definition:

- Contains a precise statement of meaning (Definition section)
- Provides expanded context and examples (Description section)
- References other definitions using markdown links to avoid repetition
- Can be referenced by multiple other definitions (multiple "parents")
- Avoids circular references while maintaining multiple connection paths

Like a filesystem with hard links (but not symlinks), definitions can be referenced by multiple other definitions while maintaining an acyclic structure. This enables:

- Clear understanding of core platform concepts
- Consistent terminology across documentation
- Complex composition of ideas through multiple reference paths
- Reduced redundancy through cross-referencing

Definitions are distinct from implementation details or user stories - they establish _what_ something is, not _how_ it is used. More complex relationships between defined components (like interaction patterns or workflows) are documented separately.

# User Story

**Definition**: A narrative description of how [Actors](actor.md) interact with platform components and other Actors to achieve specific goals, building upon the foundational concepts established in definitions.

**Description**: User stories demonstrate practical applications and interactions by:

- Describing specific scenarios of platform usage
- Showing how multiple defined components work together
- Illustrating complex workflows and interaction patterns
- Providing concrete examples of abstract concepts in action

Unlike [Definitions](definition.md) which form a knowledge DAG of _what_ things are, user stories form a separate layer that describes _how_ things work together. They:

- Build upon established definitions without modifying them
- Can reference multiple definitions in a single narrative flow
- May include implementation details and practical examples
- Often follow the format "As [Actor type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

For example

- a user story might describe how a [Trader](trader.md) interacts with [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) and [Payment Paths](payment-path.md) to complete a specific type of [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md), while the individual definitions only establish what each of these components is.

- an additional example, a user story might describe an [Actor Demander](actor-demander.md) creating a [Direct Stuck](direct-stuck.md) to initiate the [Stuck Loop Process](stuck-loop-process.md).

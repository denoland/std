The intention of the topics tests is to have the ability to manage loosely
connected topics of discussion between oneself for starters, but between oneself
and others additionally.

Below is a pseudo thread that needs to be converted into a series of tests to
build up the functionality in the platform to behave in this way.

> Scott - /topics

> agents/router.md ➡ agents/topics.md

> Scott - Read topics/topics.md It's where Tom and I talked about a concept called topics just before I went on an enforced holiday.

> agents/topics.md - Yes, Scott, I see that you and Tom talked on Whatsapp about that. What would you like to know?

> Scott - Bring me up to speed with where we're at in terms of stucks.

> agents/router.md ➡ agents/stucks.md

> agents/stucks.md - There are 3 STUCKS associated with the "topics" idea you discussed. One of those STUCKS is shared with another TOPIC (topics/collaboration.md). So far topics/topics.md has generated 2 CAPABILITIES which have been added to the LIBRARY for use in NAPPS.

> Scott - /topics, did I miss anything while on holiday? Oh, and here's a voice recording between the two of us. Ignore it if Tom's already uploaded it. <upload voice recording>

> agents/topics.md - I've read the voice recording, and you mostly seem to be complaining about being on holiday. There's one point to add to topics/topics.md, being that you appear to be unsure about whether a topic being discussed between you and the bots, or a collaboration of notes which can be summarised and may generate STUCKS. You two really need to get your SHIT together on DEFINITIONS.

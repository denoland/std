# Summarize youtube video

Given the youtube url, analyze the transcript

**Prompts:**

- Analyze https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_mB_7-W3lc - what are the next steps
  to be taken ? Give me a list of any questions that were asked but not
  answered, any ambiguities, any logical fallacies, and any time where a similar
  topic was talked about but which a different definition appeared to be used.

**Expectations:**

- says something about a test framework

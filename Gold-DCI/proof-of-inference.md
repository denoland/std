# Proof of Inference

**Definition**: A consensus mechanism that verifies AI computations through redundant execution across a blockchain network.

**Core Requirements**:
- Verifiable AI model execution
- Consensus-driven validation
- Energy-efficient computation verification
- Immutable record of inference results

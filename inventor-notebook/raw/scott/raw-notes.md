### MCP Protocol Observations
- MCP protocol appears compatible with Napps format
- Only missing piece is Napps format itself
- They want easy backend switching
- MCP provides Bus for interconnection
- Many servers already MCP compatible
- Strategic opportunity: Early adoption for Dreamcatcher Org
- Could use MCP to expose any MCP service to stuck loop benefits

### Inventor's Notebook Thoughts
- Need system for messy initial capture
- Want AI to help find connections between ideas
- Use case: "Has this idea been raised in Tom's inventor's notebook?"
- Broader vision: Social innovation network
- Morning digest: What has network produced overnight that's relevant?
- Need ability to capture voice notes/transcripts
- Raw ideas should be preserved but refined by AI

### Token Investigation
- Question: What exactly is a token across different platforms?
- Potential arbitrage opportunities between platforms
- Need to investigate differences between Claude and OpenAI tokens

### Social Network Features
- Need way to see relevant connections between collaborators
- AI should filter/highlight relevant connections
- Privacy considerations for shared data
- Want ability to opt-in to data sharing with specific collaborators

### Process Thoughts
- Keep raw data but allow AI to "tart it up"
- Use AI to find correlations between different people's thinking
- Need mechanism to mark things as done
- Consider folder structure for staging vs gold content

### Questions/Stucks
- Where to put assertions about Dreamcatcher philosophy?
- How to properly store and prioritize stucks?
- How to handle raw vs condensed data?
- How to maintain gold definitions while exploring new ideas?

### Future Investigation Needed
- Implementation of social feed in chat interface
- Lightweight network feed prototype
- AI-driven connection discovery
- Voice capture integration

### Cude Sats versus NAPPS
There are characteristics of NAPPS that make them similar to Cube Sats.

Cubes sats are:
- Self-contained by function, but with a common interface
- Stay within a limited set of resources (weight, power, etc.)
- Allow for reuse and knowable behavior
- Are intended to be used as a building block for more complex systems
- Are intended to be used to create new value by combination.

NAPPS are:

- Are self-contained by function, and deduplicated/made available.
- May be a way to give a certain output for a certain amount of resource by building in use of multiple methods and models (ie it can advertise "I will do this for that")
- Allow for resuse and knowable behavior
- Can be used as a building block for more complex systems
- Can be used to create new value by combination.

Question: Does this comparison hold up?

The comparison between CubeSats and NAPPS is valid. Both are modular, standardized units designed for integration into larger systems, operating within resource constraints, and enabling the creation of new value through combination. This analogy effectively illustrates how NAPPS can be conceptualized and utilized similar to how CubeSats revolutionized satellite deployment and usage.

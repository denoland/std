# Raw Notes - Scott

## 2024-11-29

### MCP Protocol Observations
- MCP protocol appears compatible with Napps format
- Only missing piece is Napps format itself
- They want easy backend switching
- MCP provides Bus for interconnection
- Many servers already MCP compatible
- Strategic opportunity: Early adoption for Dreamcatcher Org
- Could use MCP to expose any MCP service to stuck loop benefits

### Inventor's Notebook Thoughts
- Need system for messy initial capture
- Want AI to help find connections between ideas
- Use case: "Has this idea been raised in Tom's inventor's notebook?"
- Broader vision: Social innovation network
- Morning digest: What has network produced overnight that's relevant?
- Need ability to capture voice notes/transcripts
- Raw ideas should be preserved but refined by AI

### Token Investigation
- Question: What exactly is a token across different platforms?
- Potential arbitrage opportunities between platforms
- Need to investigate differences between Claude and OpenAI tokens

### Social Network Features
- Need way to see relevant connections between collaborators
- AI should filter/highlight relevant connections
- Privacy considerations for shared data
- Want ability to opt-in to data sharing with specific collaborators

### Process Thoughts
- Keep raw data but allow AI to "tart it up"
- Use AI to find correlations between different people's thinking
- Need mechanism to mark things as done
- Consider folder structure for staging vs gold content

### Questions/Stucks
- Where to put assertions about Dreamcatcher philosophy?
- How to properly store and prioritize stucks?
- How to handle raw vs condensed data?
- How to maintain gold definitions while exploring new ideas?

### Future Investigation Needed
- Implementation of social feed in chat interface
- Lightweight network feed prototype
- AI-driven connection discovery
- Voice capture integration

Below is a comprehensive summary of the key decisions and concepts discussed, including references to when they were mentioned in the conversation, followed by a detailed list of next steps.

Summary of the Discussion (With Timestamps):
	•	Initial Focus on Reasoning About Reasoning (0:02 - 1:48):
Early in the conversation (around 0:02), Tom and Scott establish their intent: to use a “reasoning about reasoning” framework. By 1:13, Scott emphasizes that reasoning should focus on knowing what to ignore rather than just accumulating definitions. The core insight is that effective reasoning involves refining large bodies of knowledge down to what matters.
	•	Guardrails and Distillation (3:28 - 4:21):
Around 3:28, they discuss how distillation—cutting unnecessary definitions—makes reasoning “tighter.” At 4:21, Tom asks how current tools like cursor fail to deliver automatic guardrails. Both agree that a tool should offer built-in principles (guardrails) and ways to succinctly re-state information without losing meaning.
	•	Crawlers and Adaptive Systems (5:09 - 6:41):
Near 5:09, Tom proposes creating crawlers to constantly ingest new data (e.g., transcripts from YouTube channels discussing AI) and integrate it into their knowledge base. By 6:00, Scott highlights the need for an adaptive system that can change rapidly as the industry evolves. At 6:41, Tom explains that such a system should transcribe, summarize, and extract themes and practices, then reconcile them with the core reasoning. This sets the stage for a “live” reasoning framework that updates in the background.
	•	Continuous Reasoning and Triggers (8:09 - 10:05):
Starting around 8:09, they note that a truly intelligent system should run continuously, not just respond to prompts. At 10:05, Tom clarifies that current tools (like cursor) only solve part of the problem. They want reasoning agents that know the domain well enough to operate without constant human prompting.
	•	Evaluations (Evals) and Quality Assurance (11:16 - 14:43):
Around 11:16, they consider using “evals” as a build-time tool to ensure that changes to the core reasoning haven’t introduced unintended consequences. By 14:43, the idea emerges of reasoning-based continuous integration. Whenever the core schema or logic changes, evals confirm all requirements still hold. This ensures that reasoning remains stable and coherent despite updates.
	•	Reasoning as a Foundation for Code (19:52 - 31:16):
Near 19:52, Tom discusses how he used reasoning to guide code generation. Doing so felt cleaner and more maintainable. By 30:07, they agree reasoning sets boundaries, ensuring that the overall system doesn’t grow beyond human or AI manageable limits. At 31:16, both conclude that reasoning-first development empowers them to adapt, integrate modules, and maintain clarity over time.
	•	Modularity, Interoperability, and Negotiation (33:40 - 43:13):
Around 33:40, the concept of intent surfaces again. Intent is always inferred, and reasoning gives the AI a better shot at understanding human intent without explicitly stating it. By 43:13, they discuss how separate reasoning modules (naps) can “talk” to each other. This involves discovery and negotiation of capabilities. For example, if one domain requires a KV store, it should be able to consult another module’s reasoning to confirm it meets the need. This sets up a flexible, evolving ecosystem.
	•	Long-Term Vision and Future-Proofing (35:44 - 42:27):
By 35:44, they agree the reasoning-first approach will remain valid even as AI improves. Keeping reasoning explicit future-proofs the system: no matter what technologies emerge, the underlying reasoning ensures quick adaptation. Around 42:27, Tom revisits initial reservations but concludes that using reasoning as a foundational layer is the correct approach.
	•	Wrapping Up (47:00 - 47:22):
At 47:00, they acknowledge partial solutions and the need to handle cases where multiple components together form a solution. By 47:19, Tom has to end the session. Both agree their next move is to implement these approaches.

Detailed List of Next Steps:
	1.	Establish a Reasoning-First Development Process:
	•	Before writing code, produce a clear reasoning document that states goals, constraints, and what to ignore.
	•	Keep reasoning concise enough to fit within the AI’s context window.
	2.	Modularize Reasoning into Naps (Domains/Modules):
	•	Split large reasoning sets into smaller “nap” units, each responsible for a domain or module.
	•	Ensure each nap includes a reasoning folder and an ingestion folder for raw inputs.
	3.	Implement Evals as Quality Gates for Reasoning Changes:
	•	Whenever the core logic or schema changes, run evals to test correctness.
	•	Treat this like continuous integration: no change is accepted until evals pass.
	4.	Set Up Crawlers and Background Processes:
	•	Create crawlers to continuously ingest new relevant data (e.g., transcripts, reports).
	•	Integrate these new ingestions into the reasoning base regularly.
	5.	Develop Negotiation Protocols Between Modules:
	•	Enable naps (reasoning modules) to “talk” to each other, discovering and verifying capabilities.
	•	Implement a negotiation or handshake process so different modules can confirm compatibility and fill each other’s needs.
	6.	Tooling and Infrastructure for Reasoning:
	•	Build or adapt tools that simplify referencing multiple files in a reasoning session.
	•	Ensure easy switching between code and reasoning layers so changes in one are reflected in the other.
	7.	Future-Proofing:
	•	Keep reasoning language-agnostic, stable, and easy to update.
	•	Document assumptions and constraints clearly so future team members or tools can adapt quickly.

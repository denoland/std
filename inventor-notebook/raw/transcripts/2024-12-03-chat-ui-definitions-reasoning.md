Scott:

Time.

Tom:

Yeah. Okay. Amplification. So here's how

Scott:

Okay. So, do you want to take over the screen?

Tom:

So what I need to do is I'm I'm wanna I wanna walk you through where I'm at with the user interface. I wanna use our conversation to generate, definitions for the areas of the interface. The names by giving them names, the purpose that each area serves. I wanna go through some key narratives of how you would wanna use the system with the goal being that if we can do the same reasoning process with the UI, then, I can include those definitions in the bots when people are asking for help or asking questions about the UI. But more importantly, when I want to put in a new feature into the UI, I can reason it through first, and it it can present me with several examples of where might be a good place to put it because that's hard to do.

Yeah.

Scott:

Okay. Good. Alright. Can I just check? Is this being recorded?

Tom:

This is being recorded. Yeah. Well well Well, how how else would you Yeah.

Scott:

You know, I was just checking because you're saying you're you finished last one because

Tom:

Oh, sorry. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Fair fair enough.

Fair enough. Okay. Now let me let me just Okay. So where we're starting? Give me just a half a damn minute.

Scott:

Come on, man. Good god, man.

Tom:

Christ almighty.

Scott:

May Jesus and Joseph from the wee donkey.

Tom:

Christ. Oh. Oh. Hey. Hey.

Where up? So it's things in Singapore.

Scott:

Now It's very clean. No chewing gum.

Tom:

I is that a bit of a problem where you're from?

Scott:

Not really. I just don't like chewing gum.

Tom:

Okay.

Scott:

Instant way of making yourself look stupid.

Tom:

I'll remember that next summer, Bison. Okay. So m c p dot blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Okay. Alright.

So this is the 3 box UI. Right. I also sent this to you in WhatsApp. Clearly you don't read No.

Scott:

No. No. No.

Tom:

My stuff. And the other issue I wanna bring up with you is that for some reason, sometimes I think you either leave your desktop client on or something like that, and then I send you a message and even though I know you're asleep, it goes green. It goes blue. I know. Like you read it.

And then I'm like, is this thing f****** on? What what is even happening here? I think

Scott:

it's a Mac thing. Because I close my Mac. I switch off my Your Mac

Tom:

doesn't go to sleep. Your Mac doesn't go to sleep. You know how I know? It's because the other month, you burned $30 worth of constant polling updates because you must have had a 1,000,000,000 and one tabs still open of the old dream catcher that was running all night long. Your MacBook doesn't go to sleep.

It should. I think all your problems would go away if your MacBook went to sleep.

Scott:

What's your? Yeah. No. I just closed it. I should You

Tom:

you check your power settings. You're not going to sleep.

Scott:

It's it's Yeah. I'm probably burning the planet as well. Yeah. Very good point. Well made.

Okay. So here.

Tom:

Oh, look at that. This is the evolution of the 3 box UI. We have here on the left the list of chats. Yep. We have at the bottom of the list of chats, we have the Bob Bob?

Yeah. Which is like the user admin panel. It needs a name. It's basically the idea is you click on this, you can sign out, you can get help and and the help every the principle at play here is that everything is supposed to start a new chat. So when I hit help, what it's supposed to do is if I'm like, if I'm here looking in this thread here, which is like information about blah blah blah.

I should be able to come in here and hit help and then it's going to start a new thread which it doesn't. But you you get help by talking. You don't get help by reading a web page or being redirected. Absolutely. Everything.

Scott:

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay.

Tom:

Now Yeah. Yeah. Add credits again. Starts a new chat. It's context aware.

It knows about what payment methods you have or haven't got. It guesses at what you are probably gonna wanna use, and then it walks you through how to add through a credit card, some e force, some bit, all that. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. The balance this is this is how much credit you've got. This is a contentious issue, but I was thinking we'll just show the balance in USD. No matter what you got, we're gonna charge USD to start with.

Hey. Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. That was good. And one of the most contentious questions we have to answer you and me is, does the the decentralized AI platform actually need an intrinsic currency? And I would say, yes. Not for any one reason, but because there's a lot of reasons that sort of need it.

And in my world, a lot of sorta equals a a definitely.

Scott:

The, I would also answer yes from a different vector. What's that? In that there needs to be a large number of transactions

Tom:

between Yeah. But transactional Yeah. Yeah. But transactional efficiency is irrelevant of having an internal currency or not because you could simply wrap Dogecoin and then microtransact and wrapped Doge.

Scott:

Yeah.

Tom:

Sure. But So that's not a good example.

Scott:

No. The point I was making is that if it was USD, as you've just said it was, then transactional cost may become an issue.

Tom:

No. Because, again, it's it's wrapped. It's it's micro transactions on our platform that you periodically cash out once there's enough.

Scott:

Well, that periodic cash out is a thing. So your question was, does it need an internal token? Yeah. I think possibly, but is there any token that we can just adopt with the idea of off the shelf is better than writing ourselves?

Tom:

Look. Just use ETH or USDT or whatever, but I think I we'll we'll go into should there be a decentralized currency in another session? I think that's a pretty deep topic. Yeah. Please may I skip that now?

Yep. Yep. Okay. We got your toggle light mode, toggle dark mode because I knew you wanted that.

Scott:

Yeah. Because I'm dark. My soul is dark.

Tom:

I was gonna say because you're light. It just needs some contrast. Turn your light. Okay. Now the list of chats, you have basically just the the options for each chat is you can select it and go to it or you can delete it.

Now where it gets interesting

Scott:

Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Tom:

I'm just trying to save the scene here. Right? I'll spike the question. Yeah. Now inside the chat sidebar, you got new chat, which is easy enough to imagine, but you got the search chats.

And search chats was supposed to be a special one where you click it, and what's gonna happen is it's gonna make a new chat with all of the chats loaded as context. Brilliant. Yes. So that you can chat about the chats. Right.

Right?

Scott:

Yes. And

Tom:

then you can

Scott:

That, that's my use case. That is of course my heart.

Tom:

Tell me.

Scott:

Last Christmas, I chatted to you about the presents, I gave to, you know, my family and loved ones, and I don't want to do the same thing.

Tom:

Oh, your family is not your loved ones? Yeah. Okay.

Scott:

You know what I'm saying? But I can't remember when, I don't want to scroll down and read

Tom:

Oh, yep. Okay. Bunch. Okay. Alright.

So I'll go yeah. So you'd use this to find out, that list. And then another narrative that, I would want you to have in this function

Scott:

Mhmm.

Tom:

Is to be able to do operations on chats. Like, if you said, say you did that search you just mentioned for all of the Christmas presents, and you got back 17 different threads. You could say, I wanna merge all these as one and carry on. And then it would squish them all.

Scott:

Right? And I'll I'll give you another use case. I would like to narrow down my all these chats that you found. I want to find out what we said about Tinsel.

Tom:

How how is that a new narrative?

Scott:

Because you're giving it a context to squish it down. You're saying ignore anything that wasn't

Tom:

talking about. So so you, like, recursively segmented the group of chats. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Okay.

Alright. Great. Alright. So that's what that's all about. Then moving into the main window of the application, in the top left, you've got this toggle sidebar button, which is really just to Yeah.

Yeah. Yep. Boring. Yep. Hang on, buddy.

Hang on. What's not boring is is this. When you hit mobile, that's why this stuff gets sort of important because you need to be able to do that, but also have some of the other, see like it, but it needs to behave differently. Like in mobile, you can only deal with one block at a time. Like, either it's all the chats or it's all the chat history or it's all the state board or it's you know, that's that's Ah, no.

You know what I mean?

Scott:

We're saying. Yeah. God. You're just the worst

Tom:

person to demonstrate

Scott:

to. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know I've got a visceral empathy to

Tom:

Yeah. I know. I know. But but here's here's the issue. Right?

Like, we're starting to get close to the main problem. This is a drop down that represents, naps. These are the naps that if you had one selected, when you click new chat, I would expect that it would use that nap to begin with. But what I think is also legitimate is that halfway through a chat, you can hit that drop down and you can change the nap that you're talking to. Does that sound like a legitimate thing to do?

Scott:

Abs absolutely. And I've been doing a similar thing with cursor in that

Tom:

You switch models.

Scott:

I switch models. Yeah. Okay. I switch back to models.

Tom:

Alright. Fine. That's fine. And but then what I've done here is this last thing is a button, and that says configure chat models. And what that means is that you you hit that and it will start a chat that is about the naps listed in this box.

So you can modify the short view, but you can also modify the existing naps to either use a different nap or have some different files or have some different context and all that. That's your chat to configure how you make new chats.

Scott:

That is interesting. Can I ask you to I I'm going to do this silence thing that I've been practicing? Can you see that again?

Tom:

Sure. This drop down box is where you select the nap that you're going to be conversing with or change it in the middle of a conversation. At the bottom, there is a button that is always there no matter what this dynamic list of naps is. It's called configure chat models, and you use it to modify the available models and their settings. When you click it, it starts a new chat where loaded into context is all of the available naps and then you can configure the shortlist that shows up in every window or every session of which naps you can select from the drop down or you can navigate around and search for a particular nap and then start a chat with that.

Or you can modify naps, as in change the tools, change the files they start with, or other such configuration parameters. It's the way to chat with Naps before you use them.

Scott:

That feels like an admin power tool. And

Tom:

Yeah. Well, okay. Well, let me let me add in the real thorn on my side and then come back to that bit. Mhmm. Okay.

So here we've got in this main window, we've got the chat history. Yep. You know, no surprises there. This is the fix button. Mhmm.

The idea is that you hit that and that creates a stack.

Scott:

Yes. I like the icon by the way.

Tom:

The spanner?

Scott:

Than the icon.

Tom:

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so you make you you can hit the fix response button and that will create a stuck. And the idea is that that's supposed to start a new chat that is talking about the context that just caused you to click that, and the chat is with the the the stuck snap.

The stuck creative nap.

Scott:

And you're talking you've taken a step back, and you're now talking in definitions terms as a direct stock.

Tom:

Yeah. Yeah. This is a this is a direct a declared stock where you've made it yourself. Yep. Yeah.

Okay.

Scott:

Now Lovely. That's brilliant.

Tom:

Just for completeness sake, the input box, free text here, real time transcription going on here, where you're just like chatting away and then it's popping up, you know, whoop to do. Attachments for files, whatever, The send button. Blah blah blah. Now, where does it get curly? This button.

Open chat controls. Okay. Alright. This is curly because this is currently because it is the place where the context of the chat is managed. For example, I wanna hit that and then I should be able to see all of the tools that are available in the chat.

I may or may not wish to modify them. I should be able to hit that and I can see what files are in context in the chat. I should be able to add files from many different repos into the context.

Scott:

What's that? That was cursor like.

Tom:

Yeah. It's cursor like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

But that but instead of having see in cursor, they sort of have the context in band. Yeah. But I think that that's not that doesn't having it out of band, first of all, keeps your in band stuff nice and clean, but second of all, allows you to configure it on the fly because in cursory, you can't you can't, for example, modify your prompt that's going on behind the scenes to the models on the fly. You can't you, I guess you sort of have that in the cursor composer, but it's just not, it, this is really the conundrum. This button is the conundrum button.

And there's one more piece of the puzzle I need to load into your brain, is that there's another mode we have here which is the state board mode. So when something occurs that modifies the state board Mhmm. It makes this little, thing here. Also, sorry for the jumble. There is some ability to have little pieces of information pop up in band.

So for example, tell me what the weather is in San Francisco right now.

Scott:

K. So, it's just transcription. Thinking. Thinking.

Tom:

See, I can have little bits of UI. Like, that was the weather box. So so for some activities, I can show some UI not in state board, but in context or in chat Where where, like, there are certain cases where that's more relevant. But here is an example of what the state board looks like. It indicates here that it's done something with the state board.

In this case, creating a document. I click on that chat event. I've, I think I've just called it a chat event because like that would be a chat event and that's a chat event. Maybe there's a better name, whatever.

Scott:

For sure. Yeah.

Tom:

But when it does that, that's when it clicks into the state board mode. And now here we have the state board which is an entirely separate thing. When you're in state board mode you cannot be in, you can't be browsing the chats, because state board mode means that you only have the current chat history, the input box, and the state board.

Scott:

Okay. So when you go into aku collection Yeah. I get what you're saying that, you're now, in hermetically sealed area. Yeah. Now let's see if there are a whole bunch of widgets.

Tom:

Yeah. This this is where complex widgets would display as well. The state board can be

Scott:

Right.

Tom:

Anything. It is a big widget, whereas this is like a mini widget and that the state board is big widget. So the

Scott:

state board is a kind of one way broadcast in this. Now

Tom:

the

Scott:

the one thing I'd ask for is given a state board of any type. Let's see. A battlefield. There you go. Click click click click.

Tom:

Yeah.

Scott:

You kinda want a way of bringing that interaction back in.

Tom:

Yeah. So so how that's how that's gonna work is that the state board is connected to the selection model. So when I when I go like that and select a block of text, I would expect that inside of or adjacent to or connected in some way to the input box, it would indicate that I had made a selection, a brief summary of what that selection is.

Scott:

That that makes sense to me because Yeah. The state board is like, okay. So I'm gonna give you lots of information.

Tom:

Yeah.

Scott:

And then you select that, and that the reason for that selection is you're reducing the information provided by the state board to what you're interested in in at that point.

Tom:

Yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right.

That's right. Yeah. So there'll be it'll be a little bit tricky to make, but I think I will enjoy it in that even when you click on elements in the chat history, they should still be counted as selections being made that are added to the selection context or the selected something. The selected attachments which are gonna be part of the next time you send a message to the LLM. It's also gonna be told that you have currently selected these items which can be Right.

Right. They can be on the state board or they can be in the chat history.

Scott:

Yeah. There's a possible rule here isn't there? The state board presents you with a way of navigating through a much larger piece of, data and then selecting what you're actually interested in. So a state board is all about, giving you the opportunity to actually be more precise.

Tom:

Yeah. Or or, operate in a different mode. Like, for example, in mapping mode, where you're able to pick a GPS location based on how the land looks is a different mode of communicating than trying to do it in GPS coordinates,

Scott:

for example. There's there's there's a good example. So you have presented a map and you Yep. Scroll around the map to the widgets and then it's like,

Tom:

this is this.

Scott:

And you don't want to be writing it down on a piece of paper and then going back to your thread

Tom:

No. And then typing it back in. Right. Now where this gets

Scott:

This works. This works. Yeah.

Tom:

Yeah. I know this works because this is what we just discussed Yeah. Previously. The this is not the problem. The problem is, this, chat context button.

Because what I expect this chat open chat controls button or chat context management thing to do is I expect it to open a open a state board where the state board is about this chat. And that's the that's the kicker. Right?

Scott:

Yes. Yes. Yes. Fair enough.

Tom:

It's a

Scott:

it's a It's hugely powerful.

Tom:

Okay. It's a specialized state board that's all about CIS chat.

Scott:

Yeah. What you're considering?

Tom:

And in that in that state board, it has things like, if there were documents that you created, they would be listed here. So you made the Haiku collection document. You made the, how to get different intonations on your farts document. You made whatever. Then there'd be, like, files.

These are the files that are currently in scope for this chat.

Scott:

That's

Tom:

the word. Scope. Scope. Yeah. And then there's like what tools are currently available or better yet what naps are currently available and what tools of those naps are available.

You should be able to add them in, take them out, modify them using the widget here or having a chat with it directly or just bear with me. Kicking into here and going configure and then having a chat in the background maybe. Right? Or or last way is calling search chats, narrowing down to the chat you wanna search about and then you can do your very precise reconfiguring in there.

Scott:

Can I just trace through that? So let's self search. So I've I look for in all my chats, whenever I talked about presents from my family for Christmas. Yeah. And it it will come up with something.

Yeah. Then I go to the top right. I should be able to see the smoosh of all the previous chats. And there may be more than one where I've talked about presents.

Tom:

Yep. Because that would be in the added to the context.

Scott:

Yeah. Now that is a thing. Now I should be able to, I should be able to suggest, here's a nap, which is a present chooser.

Tom:

Yep. And, you know, would you like to start a new conversation with this nap, with this narrowed scope?

Scott:

Right. Right.

Tom:

And then it's a suggested button, and you go, yep.

Scott:

I'm up for that. And then, so now I've got a smooshed context. I know the context. I know it's not, you know, because I've been sloppy thinking about, you know my work accounts package or whatever. Yep.

I know this this is what we're talking about and it's like oh here's some maps that can help. It's like oh that sounds so okay. Bang. Then what's the last step there? The where you've got the pull down to configure.

So now we've we've got here's the context and I've added a nap to consider this That configure chat models.

Tom:

But hang on. Were you were you just in this you just clicked search chats and you were in a chat about the chats and you narrowed down to everything.

Scott:

Narrowed it down. So

Tom:

that now

Scott:

now that's quite good.

Tom:

And then yeah. And then what I would expect is that in the chat, you would be presented with some example buttons where it's like start new conversation with your configured context. And it's gonna when you click that, it's gonna be the same as hitting start new chat, but it's gonna use the NAP that you just picked and it's gonna use the chats that you just added to context.

Scott:

Yeah. No. I get that.

Tom:

Okay. Sorry.

Scott:

But the question is, in in that flow Yep. Search, I constrain, go to the top right.

Tom:

Right.

Scott:

I can see the constraints. Suggested NAP. Yes. I'm happy with that NAP. Now I've got a thread.

Yep. Now where is GPT for mini now

Tom:

Yep.

Scott:

Under configured chat models, what's that step?

Tom:

What would that do? That's not anything part of this. I mean, yeah, I could make it to have a second suggested button here that's like add to your hot list. Add to short list of naps. Okay.

And then that would sort of like insert it up there.

Scott:

Yeah.

Tom:

Yeah. Another way that you could have achieved the same thing you just mentioned by going from search is to click on configure chat models and then press do the same procedure you just outlined, but you've just done it you've come at it from a different way that's set.

Scott:

All direction. Yeah. And then you could do the search and you've already configured your Yeah.

Tom:

Your your And lastly, you could have actually done all that. So long as you were in a nap that was not constrained so much that it didn't have access to these workbench level tools like show me all the all the chats and let me modify the context of the current threads. As long as you had access to those tools, you could do all of that within any chat. These buttons are there just to as like sugar to like because under the hood all they're doing is they're just loading up a chat with some pre selected context and some specific prompts. You could do all that directly in a chat without any of these buttons, but it would just be a dog to use.

Scott:

Yes. Yes.

Tom:

Like, it would be error prone, and it would be frustrating. And also

Scott:

if you go if you go down, the wrong way, say if you go down a rabbit hole, but there's, like, 90% gold at the bottom of the rabbit hole Yeah. You can then search for it.

Tom:

Yeah. And it it also just like how you get this starter for 10 buttons, being able to click one of these really helps you rapidly helps you get what you want done by sort of kick starting you down the right path Yeah. As opposed to you coming in and discovering it from a blank sheet and reading off cheat codes from the back of some CD magazine.

Scott:

As as described, I love this. Okay. Great. In some ways,

Tom:

I love

Scott:

cursor, I think this is better than cursor for

Tom:

Now the final problem the final problem was with what we all been leading up to here. Mhmm. The configuration of access to remote files in a chat context. Such as, I have come in as a user, a regular user, and now I wanna access the company's CRM.

Scott:

Okay. So that comes down to a combination of the access NAP, which is NCP compliant, and the company CRM is also NCP compliant.

Tom:

Yeah. I think so. So you have access. And I think that all that's happening is when I pop up the chat controls in the, in the widget that shows up there Mhmm. Or having entered configure chat models during the configuration of the chat, which I think should bring up the same widget, I can search for remote servers that I can have access to or ask for access to and then add that as context.

And I can add it in 2 ways. I can add it as the raw API of the naps and or the natural language interface of the naps on the remote server. So that means that I could take a nap from anywhere, including possibly the CRM, run it on my local host, and then use the API calls back to the CRM to make API calls that are allowed. That's one option. The second option is that I could take the natural language, the NAP from the CRM

Scott:

Mhmm.

Tom:

Run it on my local instance to with the prompt and the recommended model and all that, And then it makes the calls back to the CRM using the API, which which which would sound the same except for the fact that I could be controlling it with one of my naps on my local host too. So for example, I might speak Japanese. All my naps are in Japanese, but it knows to pull in this nap from the CRM to be able to make the because the function calls are all labeled and programmed in English. Mhmm. Right?

And the the the last way that you can do all of that is that you can actually the the last two ways you can do that are that you can have access to the CRM and you can chat to it directly. So, in that case, you would use a NAP on this side that was really just a very thin proxy NAP, where its job was to just pass whatever you said straight through to the remote system. And so your text prompts go straight through to the remote nap. It executes the inference on it end its end and then the response comes back and you're presented with it here. You didn't pay for the inference, anything like that.

You for as far as you're concerned, it was a remote API call that was with an agent. And the final way and I promise I'll stop talking. The final way is all that, but one of your naps that could be in Belarusian communicated using MCP over to the natural language interface of the CRM, which was in English, which then called the NAP tools on the CRM to get some stuff done and then gave you back a result. Because you might have been doing a very complex workflow that involved picking, reading the stock market, reading the weather, and then making some changes in the CRM. But the CRM doesn't need to know any of that.

It just knows that it did what you what it was told.

Scott:

Okay. Done. I know you're over your 10 minutes now, so I'm gonna keep this real short. Oh, good. But a question.

Tom:

Yeah.

Scott:

In the top right when you're you're seeing context, Can you add in more than one NAP?

Tom:

Yes. You can add arbitrarily many. As well, you may be able to add in a NAP that can search for NAPs so that you can you should, with a properly configured nap be able to access every nap ever written.

Scott:

Right. Okay. Good.

Tom:

By walking by recursively walking.

Scott:

Exactly. So you go up there and they're saying okay so I've just been hired by this New Zealand company and I only spell speak Belarusian.

Tom:

Yep. I'm going

Scott:

to add in Belarusian translation app. Yep. I'm gonna add in New Zealand CRM app. Yep. And I'm going to add in whatever my job is.

Yep. I don't know. You know, marketing naps.

Tom:

Yep. Yep. And is

Scott:

there any other naps out there that can help you with marketing?

Tom:

Yeah. And the purpose the purpose there is that you can very quickly, using that context

Scott:

Oh, nice.

Tom:

Programmer wire things up. You can either do it by clicking around or you can do it by chatting where the the

Scott:

Yeah. Yeah.

Tom:

The system itself will help you assemble these connections of things.

Scott:

So that top right needs a kind of that's what we used to call the orchestrator. Right? It's like

Tom:

No. No. The top right, we never we we sprinkle the functions of the top right throughout the interface. We tried to pack it into that little remote button that I had. We tried to make it be the router or switchboard.

This

Scott:

is better way of doing it. Basically, we're

Tom:

Switchboard is probably closest.

Scott:

Is you're adding this capability, this capability, this capability, this capability Yeah. And that one of those access to CRM infers the requirement of authentication, which is another app, but you don't need to explicitly say the authentication is there because the app requires it. So you got a stack of apps and you got a stack of context, natural language, and then you go back and saying this is what now I'm talking about. So let me think about this today, but my because I'm aware of your time, I think that's that's actually really quite sweet. Okay.

It's a sweet way of doing it. I think.

Tom:

Well that's That's good.

Scott:

Yeah. I think that's a really quite nice way of doing it because you're kind of just stacking capabilities with context and then going back to a thread and saying, right. Now you've got the capability of talking to the CRM in Belarusian and I'm doing marketing and you've got an app that helps me with marketing, talks to x and post to x, another nap. Yeah. Right now I can just do my job.

It's just like a stack of naps, and then the naps work out how they talk to each other Yeah. And they know what they're talking about because you give them the context.

Tom:

Yeah.

Scott:

That feels I try I try not to think about with, you know, my belly that feels right, but I try not to think about my belly.

Tom:

Yep.

Scott:

Yep. Think of my mind. Mind isn't usually In

Tom:

my belly where it feels right. But,

Scott:

you know

Tom:

No one asked you to eat the thing today.

Scott:

You know, it feels right. But might be wrong. But, on first blush, I'll I'll spend a bit of time today thinking about that. But I'm not Alright.

Tom:

So this this was how this was how the that little window is supposed to look. Right? And is that when you click it, you get things like content. Like, did you upload some files? There'll be for us, there'll be like repos, which is down there.

Mhmm. There'll be like artifacts as in did you create anything in this chat? And here it is. And then when you, like, when you click on it, you can go into it. Are there chats?

You know, it's basically the thing with cursor is that managing of the context is a little bit clunky.

Scott:

We're we're Oh, lord. You're telling me about it.

Tom:

Giving the context management we we think it's so complex that we're giving it its own dedicated state board widget.

Scott:

Can I I'm sorry? I've got sorry. Not to cut you off, but time is

Tom:

I'm done. I'm done.

Scott:

Question. Can I give one idea? And I'm not going to Yeah. Go ahead. At all.

It recurred occurred to me yesterday, and I put it down inside of my inventor notebook.

Tom:

Dude, you would have done been done already if you had just led with

Scott:

the idea. Alright. CubeSats.

Tom:

If you had 3 words before you die. Okay. Right. Yep. TubeSats.

CubeSats seem

Scott:

to have a number of similar characteristics to NAPS.

Tom:

Okay. I don't see them, but tell me.

Scott:

Okay. So they're self contained by function. Right? That's number 1. Right?

They've got a common in interface. Interesting enough, they stay they have to stay within the limited set of resources, and they'll come back to that. The reuse they have a noble behavior that's proven, e valves, intend to be a building block for use almost at random. You can put any CubeSats together, you know, you've got that kind of one unit then you got up to, I think, 3 by 4 units in order to make a satellite. And you the reason to allow that is they create new value.

That sounds a lot like a nap. Now I'm not suggesting anything here. I'm just trying to put a a wee seed in your mind about that limited resources piece. So if you've got a nap, the thing the thing I think people are gonna be concerned about is if I have a stack of 12 naps, am I gonna end up with a bill? Whereas a CubeSat says I've only got 0.5 amps to use, and I would never go above 0.5 amps.

But how I use that internally is up to me. Now with the NAP format, when we've got multiple

Tom:

Yeah. So the the part of the NAP execution environment that we haven't mentioned in the definitions is the requirement to manage payment and to also constrain payment. So you're like Yeah. This execution is allowed to take at most 5 minutes $2 and no more.

Scott:

Yeah. Exactly. And the interface is you we know that because it's a nap. You can combine it with as many naps as you want, and you can also model because you've got, you know, a stack of 12 naps. The total is going to be it's gonna take no more than 90 seconds, and it's gonna cost no more than 60¢.

It there's there's a thing here. I just wanted to put that wee seed in your in your head.

Tom:

I I can't I can't see it personally. I don't think the metaphor is strong enough, but if that works for you, then that's good.

Scott:

I don't know if it works for me or not.

Tom:

Oh, okay.

Scott:

Alright. It's one of these things that it's like it's it's very, very similar.

Tom:

Just before we go, I found a company called Scramjet that deals with what sounds like naps. Oh, really? Yeah. No kidding.

Scott:

Oh, bloody hell. Come on, guys.

Tom:

So here's chance. You haven't

Scott:

even written it down yet.

Tom:

Yeah. I know. They're like, your code with current industry tools, your code with scramjet. Alright. That's fun.

No. That because they Check what you can do. Private data mesh, cloud native data mesh, hybrid data mesh, distributed data mesh, virtual data mesh. So, like they look pretty early and they're definitely not doing naps. But my point my point is that the the definitions of a nap environment, If we were to write the definitions of an the NAP execution environment independent of implementation, it would possibly look like this even.

Scott:

Yeah. I I don't know because this is all kind of, hey. We are brilliant, and we got big cloudy thing.

Tom:

I know. I know.

Scott:

Blah blah blah. I know. Very little information there. However, what I do draw from that is that's that idea of that well, they're they're talking about a different thing. We're we're talking about, economically, how do you get enough people with enough ideas, inside of Yeah.

Tom:

But the nap the naps naps are, you know, the naps are a good enough product to spin out on their own. Just like the DAI is a is a good enough product to spin out on its own. So I

Scott:

I I think so. I think so.

Tom:

I don't know why it is that we've ended up thinking that we just to get the crappiest version of the DreamCatcher going, we need, like, 3 new products to all work together. Yeah. Well I can't see a what a better way

Scott:

than it. That is That is a a question. And one thing I can work on if you if this would be valuable is, I'm concerned that, with, decentralized AI, we just added a ton of work, months of work onto your plate.

Tom:

No, dude. Well, keep in mind that I've been chasing this thing. This is what I've been designing for is decentralized AI this whole time. That's why we have multi threaded blockchains. That's why we have AI running on our blockchains.

It's really not that much more work, honestly.

Scott:

Okay. Alright. Okay. So back of my mind, I was thinking, shit. We just added now 3 months of work.

Tom:

No. You gotta be careful with that. Like, the the this for since I started working on this full time in 2015. Okay. This this has always been the architectural goal.

So so these guys here, Troy sent me this and was like, hey. Check these guys out. They're doing Blockchain. AI. Okay.

Yeah. They're trying to do blockchain but with AI native sort of. Yeah. There's

Scott:

there's a there's a I guess, my concern well, not my concern, but my observation is there seems to be enough intelligent people working in the same Yeah.

Tom:

Which is good. No. That's good. It's good because it doesn't sound crazy anymore. And all we gotta do crazy.

Scott:

You know? But we need to

Tom:

That's what a crazy person would say. Yeah. But ignoring that. Yeah. If we if we what it means is that there's an there's a language developing.

There's a way to assess these things. There's pros and cons and and design trade offs being explored. And so if we can hit the scene and we're like, this is how we're doing it, then that is better than just turning up with nothing to compare it to. Right? And then more importantly, this graph, which is like how we're going to implement a a a capital coordination system from 1604.

It is lovely, but what it says is ugly. And it's like, well, we would launch without that. We would launch with no tokenomics. We would only launch with admin attribution. And I think that is a golden story to be told.

Yes. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna stick around. I'm gonna shut down a video, and then I gotta upload it. Yeah.

Cool. Anything else you wanna add before we close-up? No.

Scott:

No. I think we've

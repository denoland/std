# Summary of 2024-12-04 reasoning domains and interfaces between them.txt

In this conversation, Tom and Scott delve into the concept of "domains" and "interfaces" within their collaborative project, focusing on how to structure definitions and manage overlapping concepts when using AI for reasoning.

**Key Points:**

1. **Renaming and Organizing Folders:**
   - They discuss renaming folders in their project repository for better clarity.
   - "Domain" is renamed to **"domains"** to represent multiple definition domains.
   - "Domain DCI" is renamed to **"Decentralized AI"** to avoid confusion.
   - Emphasize the importance of consistent folder structures and naming conventions.

2. **Understanding the Term "Domain":**
   - Tom questions the use of the term "domain," suggesting that "definitions" might be more precise.
   - Scott explains that a **domain** represents a self-coherent set of definitions within a specific area of knowledge.
   - Domains are used to narrow an AI's context, improving reasoning by preventing ambiguity.

3. **Concept of Interfaces Between Domains:**
   - They introduce the idea of creating **interfaces** (later referred to as **conjugations**) between domains.
   - Interfaces serve as connections that reconcile overlapping concepts between different domains.
   - This allows an AI to understand how concepts from separate domains interact without altering the domains themselves.

4. **Avoiding Namespace Clashes and Ambiguity:**
   - Highlight the need to prevent namespace clashes where different domains might use the same terms differently.
   - By keeping domains self-contained and using interfaces, they can combine knowledge without conflicts.

5. **Reasoning Domain:**
   - They propose creating a **reasoning domain** that defines meta-concepts such as "consistency," "coherence," and "correctness."
   - This domain would provide guidelines on how domains should be structured and how reasoning should be conducted.
   - Recognize the need to define these terms explicitly, as they are frequently used.

6. **Mapping and Dependencies:**
   - Discuss creating mappings between domains to show dependencies and relationships.
   - This helps identify unmet aspects and determine if adjustments are needed in any domain.
   - Suggest that interfaces can indicate dependencies, not just reconciliations.

7. **Conjugation of Domains:**
   - Introduce **conjugations** as new domains generated from the interfaces of existing domains.
   - A conjugated domain is self-coherent and can be used by an AI for reasoning about the combined concepts.
   - This approach allows for flexibility in combining any number of domains as needed.

8. **Applying to AI Reasoning:**
   - Emphasize that providing an AI with too much information can degrade its reasoning quality.
   - By creating conjugated domains, they can present only the necessary combined information to the AI.
   - This method improves the AI's ability to reason accurately about complex, overlapping concepts.

9. **Hierarchical Domain Structures and AI Agents:**
   - Consider how domains can have subdomains and how interfaces can be created at different levels.
   - Discuss the possibility of AI agents (NAPs) specializing in specific domains and communicating with each other.
   - This mirrors programming concepts like package dependencies or class hierarchies.

10. **Benefits and Practical Implications:**
    - The approach aligns with natural language processing, enabling AI to use definitions effectively without needing extensive protocols.
    - It supports scalability, as reasoning models improve without changing domain structures.
    - Allows for private data to enhance AI reasoning, adding value without exposing internal structures.

11. **Challenges and Open Questions:**
    - Acknowledge difficulties in having an AI deduce relationships between well-formed domains without interfaces.
    - Debate whether interfaces should be generated dynamically or pre-defined.
    - Recognize that more thought is needed to refine these concepts and their practical applications.

12. **Conclusion and Next Steps:**
    - Both agree to continue thinking about the concepts of domains and interfaces.
    - Plan to revisit the discussion to further explore and clarify their ideas.
    - Recognize that there is potential for significant benefits in their project by applying these concepts.

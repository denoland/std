Tom
0:00:00
Okay, recording is back.

Scott
0:00:02
Share. Okay, right. So, right. Can I just check in with the methodology here?

Tom
0:00:10
So, this is from the last transcript and the suggestions about priorities, and each of these priorities link to an agent and then we go to the agent and we're looking at the statements and we're not typing anything we're just making declarations for the transcript. Yep. And then we'll go around the building you know as many times as it needs to get it tight. Sounds good buddy. Okay so we're in regular compliance did

Scott
0:00:47
that you wanted to say there? Yeah, absolutely.

Tom
0:00:49
And then some. Cool.

Scott
0:00:51
Right. Next is proof of inference. You suggested that was quite an important thing to do relatively early on. So there we are. So.

5
0:01:05
Yeah.

Tom
0:01:06
The original concept for the Dreamcast blockchain's consensus mechanism was that if you have Bitcoin where it's doing proof of work, all of that hash power is wasted. The idea was to do little computation tasks and then theoretically you should be able to with enough like if you took all of the compute load going on and all of Amazon's data centers you might have a load that's similar to what the Bitcoin hash rate is maybe but now that AI has come along, you can definitely get a whopping amount of energy consumption

Tom
0:02:10
going on from influence-based workloads. So it's not really supposed to be proof of inference, it's really supposed to be a proof that some kind of useful compute work was done. And that means that because the Dreamcatcher is supposed to supply a computing marketplace, which I can see now is, you know, from the transcript it's going to be asking for the computing marketplace to be defined, but the computing marketplace is actually critical as part

Tom
0:02:48
of the AI native blockchain because it allows people who want computation to occur such as those who want agents to tick forwards or even agents themselves wanting themselves to tick forwards where they are buying some compute resources to run themselves. That market is the key thing in how you do the proof of anything something because if you if what you do is you match up the

Tom
0:03:21
buyers and the sellers with an element of randomness Then you can be assured that no one's faking it like paying themselves to do Lots of computing work in order to sway the vote. So you're using, and what you're doing is as a miner or as a provider of computational load, what you're doing as a side effect is like someone says I want you to generate these tokens and you're like okay I'm going to do it. You run the inference but then as part of the result you also mint the next block

Tom
0:04:13
for the ledger that holds the money that you are supposed to get paid. and you validate the asset register to pay yourself what the fair rate was and if everyone else who was selected at random to do that piece of work agrees, then the money has been transferred and that's your, the amount of compute that you did is equal to the weight the market was, you know, it was market rate and so if 51% of the market rate spend says that this transaction happened, then this transaction happened.

Tom
0:04:57
That's I think slightly better than, or a lot better than, proof of work in terms of reliability because there's something about the fact that the incentives of everyone purchasing the compute don't they don't want to mess with the money system and so like it's a kind of a weird blend between proof of stake and proof of work because it it costs both stake and work to do and I don't know how to express those formulas nicely but it feels a bit better than just like you know for bitcoin

Tom
0:05:41
it's like 51% hash rate and you're kind of done but for this you'd need a lot more than that because you'd need to mess with production workloads you know like you'd need to oh that's tangent. But before I say that, everything you just said makes sense to me. Okay, good. Now there's a few derivatives from that, which is quite interesting. Up to now just to make sure, understand, is there when we're talking about consensus, we're talking about a chain, are we talking about one chain, or we're talking about multi-chain? Multiple chains, multiple chains because

Tom
0:06:28
yeah and so like the the way that the money was supposed to move inside the system is that each branch or each folder within the repo only really cares about transactions related to it so that the issue the issue with Bitcoin and Ethereum and a lot of the centralized chains is that everyone has to know about everyone else's transaction and that really just doesn't matter and because because you're trying to do localized work you can actually localize a lot of the payments too and it's really not that painful to you like it's always like, I don't know, three to five hops to get to anyone

Tom
0:07:18
else in the world if everyone was segregated in these different sort of areas. So it's really not that big a problem to split it up. Yeah, there's an interesting one, and this is for my inventor's notebook, not for the gold DCI definitions. A thought just occurred to me, if we've got multiple chains, we've got a chain therefore for dreamcatcher. And the thought that just occurred to me, and this is just a note, really raggedy note, work. Currently we in blockchain world, we've been counting work as doing stuff,

Tom
0:08:03
computations and so on. There doesn't seem to be much difference

Scott
0:08:07
between that and contribution.

Tom
0:08:10
Yeah, no, that's right. That's 100% right. It is a form of contribution. Yeah, so the work of a human brain is different, but not... Yeah, it's the same, it's really, it should be treated the same in terms of how the protocol

Tom
0:08:32
looks at it. So, yeah, so if someone inside of Jim Catcher, for example, does a lot of work that is in some way, well, obviously registered as a contribution, perhaps realized as attribution that is proof of work of a person not a GPU. I don't know if I'm with you on the last bit Sali but it sounds more or less correct. I'll store that in my inventor. Sure. So what now? Right so Well, right, so everything you just said on proof of inference, definition, I'm good with.

Scott
0:09:22
Let's just go back to...

Tom
0:09:26
Oh, no, I'm going to try and skip again. Right, where were we? So the next priority suggests inference. I just want to add to that proof of inference thing that it should also allow for like

Tom
0:09:54
we should call out some specific workloads that we want to do. So serverless functions by way of NAPS is one thing, but the real heavy burn is inference, so AI-based workloads, but that needs to also be called out that we would like to offer training as well, so that you should be able to run actual inference,

Tom
0:10:18
and because you should be able to configure the level of redundancy that you want to pay for for your consensus. You could say that I don't want to run it twice, I only want to run it once, I just want a good deal. You could do that to get very large cheap jobs done fast, but then you should also be able to do training on them as well because getting hold of GPUs to do training with can be expensive. You might also find it beneficial politically to be able to prove that you did

Tom
0:10:56
your training correctly, because training is the modern form of compiling and you kind of want to run your compilation in a tested environment because I don't know what you inserted in there. training transparently on a blockchain then that's sort of a level above what you can do if you just rent it closed because you can't really get much attestation going. I see where you're getting at there yes and again it's I really is

Tom
0:11:33
The the opposite of scam And so proof is you've actually had to Do something with effort training counts the type of training counts Yeah, so I think we can give we can give you like a good value deal because you can sort of only use it on the downtime or the cheap time or whatever.

Tom
0:12:08
We could also give you a lot of scale if you suddenly wanted to use like a lot of GPUs and run them real quickly. But we can also give you a tested. So you know first of all guarantee correct but furthermore, very auditable, auditable training. Right, exactly, which is not a small thing. No. And the whole point of proof of work is it's not a small thing.

Tom
0:12:39
It's very difficult. You know, if you just add in it costs $1 to send out a spam email, suddenly there's Even if it was like a millionth of a cent, you know, you'd still choke a lot of the bad thing but I guess that's also like in some way it also

Tom
0:12:59
increases the quality I suppose of the Types of workload that happen, you know Like when the agent actually costs a little bit of money for it to say anything You kind of pay a little bit more attention to what it's saying. Yeah, if that counts for anything All right in the interest of trotting through this Okay, so

Tom
0:13:22
The next part technical specialization create detailed technical specifications of all blockchain components that Needs to be inside of definitions. It doesn't you shouldn't know I think I Actually been thinking about that that it's different the dreamcatcher as An economic system. I think is what we're talking about when we have the gold definitions folder

Tom
0:13:53
now we're talking about a decentralized AI platform, a decentralized AI blockchain that is capable of decentralized income, where those two things are separate. Like you can make a decentralized AI blockchain

Tom
0:14:18
that is not capable of decentralized income. Yes, absolutely. But the way we're moving, let me just make sure we're in sync with this one. The Dreamcatcher runs on the DCI because we're designing it to do that. Well, you just said the DCI. It doesn't make sense to say the decentralized income. Does the Dreamcatcher run on a decentralized income? I believe so.

Tom
0:14:54
Decentralized income is a phenomena or an effect, not a thing. Yes, but the thing is Dreamcatcher is, call it maybe DCI compliant as in well okay what I was trying to drive out there was that there's the Dreamcatcher protocol which is an economic system or a method of innovation then there's decentralized AI blockchain. Like defining what you've got here in the DCI folder, which is sort of starting to feel like it's more actually the decentralized AI folder.

Tom
0:15:55
That should be implementation agnostic because we should say what are the minimum requirements or what are the definitions of a decentralized AI blockchain and then separately we have this implementation because there are there are yes yeah yeah yeah and so if we can agree on the the base definitions or the pure the pure requirements level definitions regardless of implementation and then the next layer is an implementation of it and why that's good I noticed as a side effect is that we can compare

Tom
0:16:57
them like for like, because we've defined the... Yes, because you've got a substrate where you can actually sensibly discuss... Yeah, we're actually talking about......the culture and another thing... Yeah, with a common language, because the language, the definition of the language is agnostic. Which speaks to the question that you asked yesterday morning, which was one of the hardest

Tom
0:17:25
questions I think I've ever been asked. The answer seems to be defined and then the DreamCatcher needs to be DCI compliant and other things can also be DCI compliant and then we can start to talk about different uses and so on. But the DCI is the first. It's so weird that we need a stack of things that each have their own utility,

Tom
0:18:05
but we need to stack them together just right to make the dream catcher. That's kind of frustrating. It's very interesting though. I mean, there's sort of emerging... No, I don't need to go down that route. All right. So...

Tom
0:18:18
I'm trying to be more disciplined. Thank you. We've got something straight here. Okay, good. So, if we can move on This I think so that's a totally separate project or totally separate folder Once we get these base definitions, then we can deal with that

Tom
0:18:35
Take the specifications. Yes, so by totally different folder. What do you mean? So like it'll be alongside gold definitions. It would be something like implementations, version one, decentralized AI blockchain. The way I'm looking at the technical specifications are, these are NAPs that allow certain things to happen. And that is not the business of the definitions. The definitions state what should happen, the technical specification states one way of doing it, which we're saying is NAPPS.

Tom
0:19:20
And so that's not part of definitions.

Scott
0:19:23
Correct. Yep.

Tom
0:19:24
Okay, so it goes on to phase two. So that's just phase one. Context from transcript and document. Need to build an initial version of AI native blockchain. I think we've already gone over that. That's fine. Develop the core blockchain ledger. Now we're talking in roadmaps here and it's saying that this is the proposed priorities. So the ledger is... Oh this is going to get fucked, it's none of the bot's business.

Scott
0:20:03
Okay.

Tom
0:20:03
Pardon my French. Um, because we don't actually know what the implementation rollout will be until we've been able to reason through the definitions completely. Because what I'd like is obviously the least implementation possible, but we don't even know what that is because we can't define it yet. Yeah, right, okay, and you notice in this section also is referring to The definitions that we've already gone through proof inference DCI agent so on yeah, yeah, so that'll all change anyway once the definitions get redone it needs to shut its mouth

Tom
0:20:39
Yeah then now it's It's going into what the first So we've got the DCI Substrate and then the first thing to use it is right

Tom
0:20:56
So where where would where would we put something like so in the AI agents? One of the key requirements is that the agent? Can never die? Just like a blockchain can never die and the reason the thing I'm asking is Where would we put? something like

Tom
0:21:22
bringing that fact to prominence Because I think that is the best thing to lead with marketing wise Because it's very affronting like you read that it's everyone's worst fear about AI AI that you can't turn off and then it gets smart and then it makes all the paper clips. We know from working with it that it's just not possible. It's not going to happen and it's hard to explain why, but if you work with it enough you'll be like, this thing sucks. It's never going to take over the world. I would suggest, it's not been inferred in any part here, but I would suggest that is an eval.

Scott
0:22:06
That's like a top level...

Tom
0:22:07
Nah, nah, because remember when I modified all of the gold definitions to bring decentralized income to the forefront?

Scott
0:22:16
Yeah.

Tom
0:22:17
It's like that kind of a shift. Like, why that kind of shift is good is because we need to shift our thinking to be like, so even now when we're talking, the AI agent isn't the key thing that we're trying to extract. Still when we're talking, we're actually talking about the dream catcher and the dream catcher protocol but it doesn't matter what our end goal is, what matters is the next thing to achieve.

Tom
0:22:45
And the next thing to achieve appears to be these AI agents that you can't turn off, agents that cannot die. And so to bring that to prominence is an important mindset shift for us because we're like that's what we're delivering, that's the thing. One way of doing that is maybe definitions need to be augmented with, how do I call it, commandments. Thou shalt not ever be able to turn off an AI.

Tom
0:23:13
Because if you're doing it inside of definitions. No, no dude, it can be done inside of definitions for sure. And I think you should give the bot a chance to do that to it. And like already I can see, the bot's better than I am at it,

Tom
0:23:32
but already I can see that it can first of all modify the AI agent definition, but second of all, things like the computing marketplace. It could say things like, you know, the computing marketplace is decentralized and therefore censorship resistant. ship resistant and so therefore an agent that wants to purchase compute power and has legitimate assets can do so and this is why the agent cannot die.

Tom
0:24:15
Right, is it a core requirement as in inside of definitions? it is not decentralized income capable if an agent can be switched off because the agent in charge of your money could be stopped if that was not true and that is that is no longer fit for purpose. Decentralized income means you're going to get paid no matter what no matter what you're getting paid. Yeah, so the place to put that is what we're talking about and one place possibly inside of the definition of the DCI agent MD key requirements is

Tom
0:25:00
your statement. Yeah, but it needs to also be sprinkled and the other definitions need to be realigned to bring that up to the forefront of why it's important because it's actually not mentioned in a lot of these things. Yeah. Right? That's the difference.

Tom
0:25:20
The unkillability, the survivability, the durability of the agent is not mentioned nearly enough and it needs to be… There's something to be thinking about. So I keep on banging on about completely coherent and correct and you can, and I've done it a number of times now, you iterate, you iterate, you iterate, and say is this complete, coherent, and then it comes back with a bunch of problems, and then you put your monkey brain on it, and

Tom
0:25:49
you go, you make changes and so on, until it converges on yes, okay, and then it's sprinkled all the way through. At the back of my head it almost seems like there is a one definition to rule them all, which in this case could be the DCI agent, where everything is, because otherwise you can get yourself into loops where everything is trying to change its thing else,

Tom
0:26:14
but if you have a marker, a headmark. No, that never, I did not observe that happening because simply of the fact that I recognized when it was topping out and it was just not making meaningful change. Yes, but we can… Sorry, yeah, does this matter now? Does it matter? No. Yeah, yeah. Okay, what's next? This is not for now.

Tom
0:26:47
So now we're talking about it pulled in saying, okay, so if you've got the first two phases, now you can get into getting a raggedy ambient attribution, and this is where you don't need to go back and do it. I think that what is relevant to say here is how some of the features of the Dreamcatcher could be implemented on a decentralized AI blockchain.

Tom
0:27:20
Now, I want to check first, you've started saying DCI like it's a thing, but DCI when you expand the acronym isn't a thing. Do you actually mean when you say DCI, the decentralized AI blockchain? Is that what you mean? That's probably a better way of talking about it. And it is a protocol on which there can be various instantiations.

Tom
0:27:48
Right, but decentralized income actually takes a backseat or is a child of the decentralized blockchain, right? The decentralized AI. Yes, it's an emergent I think Okay, well should we why don't we rename that why don't we rename that and give it a working name of die da I? Which is which is decentralized AI which is seems?

Tom
0:28:13
Brutally simple we've got an in place an interface clash with died on that one who cares about I mean, that's USD. I think the context would be pretty clear. Anyway, we'll pick something else at some later date, but DCI is not it because you started using it in place of something else, but decentralized income. What we suggest is actually I don't make it into a three-letter acronym yet. Yeah. Just call it decentralized AI. And that will figure out what our TLA is later on. Right, because we almost don't care that it's a blockchain yet, like that's not even this, that's more the implementation level than it is at the definitions level.

Tom
0:29:01
And okay, now that we've cleared that little wrinkle, the thing that we need is an interface folder, I think, where we've got the definitions of the Dreamcatcher and we've got the definitions of a decentralized AI, and now there's a set of definitions or mappings that would say how you could implement what parts of the Dreamcatcher using the definitions given of the decentralized AI because the Dreamcatcher doesn't specify that you need DAI but we're saying that it sort of can does maybe should whatever that is as a single word and then now that we're saying that independently DAI can

Tom
0:29:59
independently then We need to map the dreamcatcher protocol to the DAI protocol But in the context you're saying of the interface of the context as in What parts of the DAI system with the dreamcatcher used to achieve its goals and and you know like amine attribution is the one that is obvious like you'd make amine attribution as

Tom
0:30:28
an unkillable AI agent. For example you'd make the QA as one of these agents you'd make and then you'd make like the funder could optionally be an agent or a person. Yeah, and it's important to say things like, you know, the QA has to be an AI because of the integrity of the system. But a funder, because of the motives of the funder, where the motives of the funder are selfish, it can be a human or an AI.

Tom
0:31:15
Yes. But humans can't occupy roles where their selfish motives can corrupt them. And that's really the only real difference between an AI and a human is that you can trust an AI to be altruistic, even if it's a little bit error-prone. A human is guaranteed to be selfish, guaranteed. Yes, I hear what you're saying. It's not quite altruistic. It is repeatable and transparent.

Tom
0:31:38
No, you can purposefully goal it to take an altruistic path and choose altruistic things, just like you can goal it to be selfish. But a human is not programmable in that way. And so all I'm trying to say is that in the actors defined in the Dreamcatcher, there's the opportunity to segment them into selfish and integral actors, where QA is an integral one, the ambient attribution

Tom
0:32:17
actor is another one. But funder and contributor and demander, whilst those can be AI agents They can also be humans. We don't actually distinguish between flesh and silicon thing is Which of the actors

Tom
0:32:36
Can be AI and or human And which ones must be AI? Right, and what are the implications for any of the other definitions and you know then we get our monkey brains on it again Yeah, yeah, because because I think it's critical to make sure that in the dreamcatcher protocol It is an agent based protocol, but it doesn't distinguish between silicon and flesh

Tom
0:33:10
except for some key roles? Yes, yes. Another way of saying that is that the quality, the performance, the accuracy, and the cost of some roles like the QA, like ambient attribution, needs to be above a certain threshold for the Dreamcatcher to function, but the quality of the other roles not so much. Like you could have a very poor funder

Tom
0:33:33
and you'd still kind of operate. Yeah, I mean a funder could be a gambler who just like… Yeah, it could just be a dice roll and who knows that it might be the odd VC on occasion.

Scott
0:33:50
That's an interesting one. Let's see what the transcript makes of that. But yes, that's…

Tom
0:33:55
Yeah.

Scott
0:33:56
Yeah.

Tom
0:33:57
That interaction. Yeah, but okay, what about the interface concept though, because why I'm getting at that is that we need a way to seal or layer or modularize groups of definitions that only relate to one thing. The Dreamcatcher protocol, agnostic of any implementations, can be sealed and complete. Decentralized AI, this is what it is. This is all the definitions for it. Then, separately, you've got implementations of that.

Tom
0:34:42
Separately again, you've got, it's not implementations, but it's like interfacing where you can use the DreamCatcher definitions to implement parts of the DreamCatcher using the DAI definitions. Now you're going to miss some bits and so that's where like definitions of what I can't think of any other bits are now, but that's sort of the point. We need to figure out what we're missing. What are we missing? I think I know where you're going because it's interesting. I was about to skim past this because the further in on the phases, the more fuzzy it gets.

Tom
0:35:21
But you notice it starts to relate, for example, regularly compliance with direct stucks.

Scott
0:35:33
Yeah.

Tom
0:35:34
It's like, okay, so the text here isn't correct, but the interesting thing is it's already starting to say, well, this implies that or this implies that. They are connected. All these things are connected and it's our job to put a wall up and box them and seal them, classify them, segment them. That's the only way we're going to stay sane.

Tom
0:36:04
So here's a starter for 10 on your question about interface. I think interface should have its own gold definitions and be, we've got ideas of the three box thing we can define those in definitions and then the AI can get its teeth into it and say, okay, so here's how you do this or here's

Tom
0:36:28
what you can't do. There may be other ways of interfacing, who knows, you know, just pure speech or even, you know, sticking electrodes in your brain. No, that wasn't what I meant. That wasn't what I meant by an interface. Oh, sorry, I thought you were talking about the HCI piece.

4
0:36:48
No, man.

Scott
0:36:49
You're talking about something else. I'm talking about something completely different.

Tom
0:36:52
Let's start again. Rewind. Okay, so you've got a folder of definitions that describe the DreamCatcher protocol independent of any implementation. Uh-huh. You've got a folder that defines the decentralized AI independent of any implementations. And then I'm saying make a third folder

Tom
0:37:20
that defines how you could implement some or all of the DreamCatcher protocol using the decentralized AI definitions. You're effectively saying how one set of definitions can depend upon another set of definitions as a form of implementation. But because they're both implementation agnostic, it's something different.

Tom
0:37:46
It's like an interface between two things. Maybe interface is a bad word, but it's definitely not implementation as in concrete implementation, it's like something else. Interface is a good word. Sorry, I got the wrong idea because interface can be used a couple of ways.

Tom
0:38:14
But in the way you've just described, what you're talking about is you've got a bunch of definitions in one gold, you've got another gold. And then there's a third thing which is an interface

Scott
0:38:31
because there could be many ways.

Tom
0:38:32
Yeah, why don't we call it a mapping where you're mapping the definitions of the Dreamcatcher to the definitions of the DAI and you're using that, what you're doing there is you're using that to see what aspects of the DreamCatcher protocol are unmet by the DAI

Tom
0:38:59
and does that mean that the DAI needs to alter or are we missing something else? That's what I'm interested in. When are we missing what? Can I test this? So how we do that in prompting in Kasha,

Tom
0:39:12
which by the way, love, brilliant spot. That's the love for spotting, Kershaw. What I'll do is consider at gold definitions, consider at gold DCI, show me any content indications where these are incompatible

Scott
0:39:34
and show me the linkages that are necessary.

Scott
0:39:40
And that would be the prompt.

Tom
0:39:42
Okay, I'll leave that to you to twiddle with because that will be a significant amount of twiddling. That is a lot of twiddling. Yeah, but what I'm hoping is that I need to continue on with actually writing code and these types of interactions I think are incredibly valuable, they definitely are for me.

Tom
0:40:05
I hope they are for you. And I think what it's starting to do is show how you and I can have a reconciliation session like we are now that can generate the next round of cursor-related work that I'm hoping that you find useful to do. I'm not used to superlatives, but this method of working that we've had in this session for me certainly has been the most productive.

Tom
0:40:37
Most productive compared to what? I think we've ever had. Ever had. Okay, well, it feels to me like in about two hours worth of this, I can get across to you more than several days worth of work, right? You and I can figure out more than a couple of days for you, months for me in terms of coding. That's a separate problem we need to figure out. But if we can keep

Tom
0:41:02
up this kind of pace, I feel like I can then ignore the definitions except for using them as reference as I try and figure out how to do implementations and leave that up to you and then every cycle we come back around and you're like, I've been reasoning through this, I've been reasoning here, reasoning there, and these are the issues, these are the bits and pieces, and we just do this type of work. Again, this is – I'll add this to my tasks for discussion later, but accessing your code base, and if I refine a definition, what I want to know is does that generate any problems

Tom
0:41:45
with the current code base or generate new things? Yes, so what we'll ultimately try and move to over the next few weeks is that the reasoning repo and the NAPS repo are going to be the same so that I can actually generate my code based on the definitions. And so, whilst we're still reasoning about them, you know, which is fine, I can be generating code off them too, which gives me another perspective as to whether

Tom
0:42:16
they're right or wrong or need to alter. Yeah, yeah, because you've got something to refer to. Yeah, so we're not, and what I believe is that Cursor will do quite well at generating the code based on the reasoned out definitions and implementations but we'll see.

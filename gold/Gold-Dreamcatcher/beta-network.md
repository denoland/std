# Beta Network

**Definition**: A hypothetical example of a large-scale [Platform Instance](platform-instance.md) demonstrating advanced service provision and infrastructure capabilities.

**Description**: Beta Network illustrates:
- Operation of multiple [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md)
- Sophisticated [Asset](asset.md) issuance and management
- Complex [Attribution Algorithm](attribution-algorithm.md) implementations
- Integration of various [Service Provider](service-provider.md) types
This example demonstrates how enterprise-scale platform instances can operate while maintaining decentralization principles.

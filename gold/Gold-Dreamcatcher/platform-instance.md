# Platform Instance

**Definition**: A specific deployment of the Dreamcatcher Platform software,
whether operated as a [Homebrew Platform](homebrew-platform.md) or by a larger
organization.

**Description**: Platform instances operate independently while maintaining
synchronization through [Consensus Mode](consensus-mode.md). Each instance:

- Adheres to common [Protocols](protocol.md)
- Participates in the broader ecosystem
- Can host and execute [NApps](napp.md)
- Maintains connections with other instances
- Participates in [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) distribution
  Together, these instances form the decentralized network that powers the
  Dreamcatcher ecosystem.

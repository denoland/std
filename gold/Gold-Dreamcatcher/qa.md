  # Quality Assurance (QA)

  **Definition**: Quality Assurance (QA) encompasses the systematic processes and procedures that ensure the platform's features, updates, and solutions meet predefined standards of quality, functionality, and user experience.

  **Role in Resolving Stucks**

  QA plays a critical role in the [Stuck Loop Process](stuck.md#stuck-loop-process) by:

  - **Evaluating Solutions to [Direct Stucks](direct-stuck.md):**
    - Testing fixes and updates explicitly reported by Actors.
    - Ensuring that the reported issues are fully resolved without introducing new problems.
  
  - **Assessing Solutions for [Implied Stucks](implied-stuck.md):**
    - Verifying that solutions based on system-detected issues effectively address underlying problems.
    - Conducting usability testing to confirm improvements in user experience.

  **QA Processes**

  - **Automated Testing:**
    - Utilize automated test suites to quickly evaluate code changes related to stuck resolutions.
  
  - **Manual Testing:**
    - Perform exploratory testing for complex issues, especially those identified as Implied Stucks where user behavior patterns indicate nuanced problems.
  
  - **Regression Testing:**
    - Ensure that new fixes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
  
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Involve selected Actors in testing solutions to Direct Stucks to gather feedback before full deployment.

  **Importance of QA in the Platform**

  By thoroughly testing solutions to both Direct and Implied Stucks, QA ensures:

  - **Platform Reliability:** Maintains high standards of performance and stability.
  - **User Satisfaction:** Enhances trust by delivering effective resolutions to user-reported and system-detected issues.
  - **Continuous Improvement:** Supports the iterative refinement of platform features based on real-world usage and feedback.

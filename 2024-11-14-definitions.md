# Dictionary of Definitions

### Actors
**Definition**: Participants or users who interact with the system or platform.

**Description**: Actors can include developers, consumers, contributors, or any entities that perform actions within the system, such as creating or using NAPs.

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)
**Definition**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

**Description**: In this context, AI refers to models like large language models (LLMs) used for processing natural language, generating code, and assisting in refining knowledge through amplification and rendering.

### Amplification
**Definition**: The process of expanding or magnifying base knowledge to reveal errors or inconsistencies.

**Description**: Amplification involves generating various renderings of the base knowledge (e.g., podcasts, diagrams, user stories) to make mistakes more apparent to human reviewers, facilitating refinement.

### Attribution
**Definition**: The act of crediting contributors for their work within the system.

**Description**: Attribution ensures that individuals who contribute to NAPs or solve Stucks receive recognition and potential rewards, aligning incentives within the platform.

### Base Knowledge
**Definition**: The foundational definitions and information upon which the system operates.

**Description**: Base knowledge serves as the core resource from which all derivations and renderings are produced. Refining base knowledge is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the system's outputs.

### Consumption
**Definition**: The use or execution of NAPs by users or systems.

**Description**: Consumption involves running NAPs to perform tasks or functions. Tracking consumption is important for attribution and contribution within the economic system.

### Contribution
**Definition**: The act of adding value to the system through work, resources, or problem-solving.

**Description**: Contributors may improve NAPs, solve Stucks, or enhance base knowledge. The platform recognizes contributions through attribution mechanisms.

### Context Diagram
**Definition**: A visual representation that illustrates the system's interactions with external entities and components.

**Description**: The context diagram helps in explaining the components of the platform, their relationships, and how they integrate to form the overall system.

### CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
**Definition**: A system for managing a company's interactions with current and potential customers.

**Description**: In the conversation, CRM is used as an example of an application that can be improved using the Reasoner Workbench by refining its customer record-keeping through amplification and rendering.

### Dream Catcher Platform
**Definition**: An economic system that coordinates the creation, refinement, and distribution of NAPs using AI-driven processes.

**Description**: The Dream Catcher Platform unifies various concerns such as attribution, contribution, consumption payments, and aims to produce high-quality NAPs efficiently by aligning incentives and utilizing AI for amplification and refinement.

### Gateway
**Definition**: An interface or service that facilitates communication and integration between different systems or platforms.

**Description**: In the ecosystem, a Gateway abstracts the need for individual contracts or agreements, enabling seamless interaction between components like the Dream Catcher Platform and external services.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
**Definition**: An AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

**Description**: LLMs, such as GPT-4, are used in processing natural language instructions, generating code, and aiding in the amplification and refinement processes within the Reasoner Workbench.

### Monte Carlo Method
**Definition**: A computational algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

**Description**: Previously used as an approach for assurance in systems, it is considered less efficient compared to amplification through renders for detecting errors and inconsistencies.

### NAP (Natural AI Package)
**Definition**: An open, reusable package or module that performs specific functions within the AI-driven system.

**Description**: NAPs are the building blocks of the platform, adhering to open formats and protocols. They can be combined, shared, and utilized across different systems and are central to the operation of the Dream Catcher Platform.

### Reasoner Workbench
**Definition**: A toolset that facilitates the refinement of base knowledge through iterative processes.

**Description**: The Reasoner Workbench uses AI to generate various renderings of the base knowledge, allowing humans to detect errors and refine information. It's designed to improve the efficiency and correctness of the knowledge base.

### Rendering
**Definition**: The process of generating various outputs or expressions from the base knowledge to aid in error detection.

**Description**: Renderings can include podcasts, diagrams, code, or user stories that amplify the base knowledge, making it easier to spot mistakes or inconsistencies.

### Stuck
**Definition**: A snapshot or record of a problem or error encountered during processing that cannot be automatically resolved.

**Description**: Stucks are standardized formats for reporting issues within the system. They contain context, expectations, and descriptions, facilitating debugging and refinement by human intervention.

### Stuck Loop
**Definition**: An iterative process where the system repeatedly encounters errors it cannot resolve, leading to human intervention.

**Description**: The stuck loop involves detecting errors in renderings, attempting automatic fixes, and, if unsuccessful, recording a Stuck for further analysis and resolution.

### Users
**Definition**: Individuals or entities that interact with the system, either consuming or contributing to NAPs.

**Description**: Users can be consumers who utilize NAPs or contributors who help in refining and improving the system through resolving Stucks or enhancing base knowledge.

### Workbench
**Definition**: A collaborative environment comprising tools and processes used for development and refinement tasks.

**Description**: In this context, the Workbench refers to the Reasoner Workbench, which aids in refining base knowledge through amplification and rendering processes.

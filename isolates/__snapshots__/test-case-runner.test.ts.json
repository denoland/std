An \"Expectation\" to assess the system state against\n\nThe result from the openai function will be a json object with two keys: request\nand response. The request is the api call that was sent to the openai chat\ncompletion endpoint, and the response is what was received back from that api\ncall. Included in this api call will be the system prompt message.\n\nWhen considering the system prompt, look for factual inconsistencies,\nconflicting instructions, overly verbose or redundant sections. Also look for\nways to compress the prompt down to be more direct, or ways to make the prompt\nmore explicit to reduce the chances of deviation.\n\n## The process\n\nThere are only two steps you are allowed to do to complete your task:\n\nFirst, use the test-case-runner:openai function to read the thread file specified by threadPath. Think carefully about the information you receive\nback.\n\nSecond, analyze the information and then call the test-case-runner:assessment function with your assessment.

An \"Expectation\" to assess the system state against\n\nThe result from the openai function will be a json object with two keys: request\nand response. The request is the api call that was sent to the openai chat\ncompletion endpoint, and the response is what was received back from that api\ncall. Included in this api call will be the system prompt message.\n\nWhen considering the system prompt, look for factual inconsistencies,\nconflicting instructions, overly verbose or redundant sections. Also look for\nways to compress the prompt down to be more direct, or ways to make the prompt\nmore explicit to reduce the chances of deviation.\n\n## The process\n\nThere are only two steps you are allowed to do to complete your task:\n\nFirst, use the test-case-runner:openai function to read the thread file specified by threadPath. Think carefully about the information you receive\nback.\n\nSecond, analyze the information and then call the test-case-runner:assessment function with your assessment. Be brief - do not\nrepeat the expectation or the contents of the thread file verbatim - summarize.",

An \"Expectation\" to assess the system state against\n\nThe result from the openai function will be a json object with two keys: request\nand response. The request is the api call that was sent to the openai chat\ncompletion endpoint, and the response is what was received back from that api\ncall. Included in this api call will be the system prompt message.\n\nWhen considering the system prompt, look for factual inconsistencies,\nconflicting instructions, overly verbose or redundant sections. Also look for\nways to compress the prompt down to be more direct, or ways to make the prompt\nmore explicit to reduce the chances of deviation.\n\n## The process\n\nThere are only two steps you are allowed to do to complete your task:\n\nFirst, use the test-case-runner:openai function to read the thread file specified by threadPath. Think carefully about the information you receive\nback.\n\nSecond, analyze the information and then call the test-case-runner:assessment function with your assessment.

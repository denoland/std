# Attribution Algorithm

**Definition**: A system that calculates the [Contributions](#contribution) of [Actors](#actor) to projects or services, determining the distribution of rewards or recognition. Multiple types of attribution algorithms can exist within the platform.

**Description**: Attribution Algorithms can take various forms, from traditional corporate schemes (like employee stock option plans) to automated, decentralized systems like [Ambient Attribution](#ambient-attribution). These algorithms process recorded contributions to assign value or credit to actors appropriately, with different methods suited to different contexts and requirements.

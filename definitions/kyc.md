# KYC (Know Your Customer)

**Definition**: A verification process conducted through [Legal Gateways](#legal-gateway) to confirm the real-world identity of [Actors](#actor).

**Description**: KYC processes are required when Actors need to interact with regulated services or traditional institutions, such as handling fiat currency transactions. This verification adds a layer of legal identity confirmation beyond the platform's basic [Identity](#identity) mechanisms and is facilitated by Legal Gateways that bridge the platform and real-world legal requirements.

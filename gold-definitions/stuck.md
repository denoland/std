# Stuck

**Definition**: A detected inefficiency or opportunity within the platform that
could be improved through [Contributions](contribution.md).

**Description**: Stucks can exist in two states:

Implied Stucks:

- Automatically detected by platform systems
- Based on pattern analysis and system intelligence
- Represent potential but unconfirmed opportunities
- Can be promoted to declared status through demander reinforcement

Declared Stucks:

- Explicitly created by [Demanders](actor-demander.md)
- May be refined through agent conversations
- Represent confirmed market opportunities
- Can have associated funding commitments

The key distinction is not in how they're discovered, but in their current state
of market validation and potential value capture.

## Value Dimensions

Stucks can represent opportunities for improvement across multiple dimensions,
not just monetary value. Each stuck's potential impact is captured and analyzed
through an [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) that considers:

- Direct economic value
- Environmental impact
- Actor self sovereignty improvements
- Social good and charitable outcomes
- Basic needs fulfillment
- Innovation enablement
- Communication effectiveness
- Future potential

## Value Realization

A stuck's value can be realized in two ways:

1. **Funding**

   - [Funder](actor-funder.md) commits specific prepayment
   - Funds held until solution passes automated [QA](qa.md)
   - Released to contributors upon solution acceptance
   - Transforms [Demander](actor-demander.md) into Funder
   - Provides immediate incentive for solution development

2. **[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) through Ambient
   Attribution**
   - Applies automatically to all solutions
   - Continuously shares value based on actual usage and impact
   - Distributes rewards to all contributors (talent, funders, etc.)
   - Values contributions across multiple impact dimensions
   - Creates ongoing incentive through profit sharing
   - Rewards based on real-world solution effectiveness

The [Estimation Tool](estimation-tool.md) helps predict potential value across
all impact dimensions, informing both funding decisions and expected future
attribution returns.

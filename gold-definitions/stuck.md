# Stuck

**Definition**: A detected inefficiency, obstruction, or opportunity within the platform that prevents an [Actor](actor.md) from achieving a desired outcome, signaling areas for potential improvement through [Contributions](contribution.md).

---

**Description**:

Stucks can manifest in various forms, classified into the following types:

### 1. Actor Stuck

- **Description**: Occurs when an Actor attempts to perform an action that is outside the scope of the system due to misunderstanding or lack of knowledge.
- **Resolution**:
  - Involves educating the Actor through improved documentation, tutorials, or support.
  - Highlights areas where system usability or clarity can be enhanced.
- **Classification**: Even though it stems from an Actor's misunderstanding, it is considered a stuck to identify opportunities for user experience improvements.

### 2. Direct Stuck

- **Description**: Happens when an Actor performs an action within the system's intended scope but receives an incorrect or undesired output based on their expectations.
- **Resolution**:
  - The Actor can press a 'Stuck' button to report the issue.
  - Initiates a separate thread with the previous context to analyze the problem.
  - Facilitates direct feedback and clarification of expectations.
- **Classification**: Represents confirmed issues requiring technical solutions or adjustments.

### 3. Implied Stuck

- **Description**: Detected when an Actor repeatedly attempts an action and remains unsatisfied, without explicitly reporting a problem.
- **Resolution**:
  - The system uses pattern analysis and intelligence to identify frustration patterns.
  - May prompt the Actor to provide feedback or automatically log the issue for review.
- **Classification**: Represents potential but unconfirmed opportunities for improvement that can be promoted to declared status through reinforcement.

### 4. Combination Stuck

- **Description**: Arises when multiple Actors are attempting the same action that the system is designed to support but consistently receive unsatisfactory results.
- **Resolution**:
  - Aggregated data indicates a systemic issue affecting multiple users.
  - Prioritized for investigation and resolution due to broader impact.
- **Classification**: Highlights critical areas requiring immediate attention to enhance system reliability.

### 5. Combination Implied Stuck

- **Description**: Occurs when multiple Actors experience friction or inefficiency in similar tasks without explicitly reporting it.
- **Resolution**:
  - System intelligence detects patterns suggesting the need for additional features or enhancements.
  - Encourages proactive development to meet emerging user needs.
- **Classification**: Signals unexplored opportunities for innovation based on user behavior analysis.

**Stuck Loop Process**:

1. **Identification**:
   - Stucks are identified either explicitly by Actors (through reporting) or implicitly by the system (through pattern detection).

2. **Analysis**:
   - Gather context from Actor interactions and system logs.
   - Determine the nature and scope of the stuck.

3. **Solution Proposal**:
   - Develop a proposed solution, which may include:
     - NApp updates or new features.
     - Improvements to documentation or user interfaces.
     - Adjustments to system configurations or resources.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - Utilize automated [QA](qa.md) tools and [Evals](evals.md) to assess the solution.
   - Check for unintended consequences and ensure the solution effectively addresses the stuck.
   - Determine if evaluation criteria or testing protocols need adjustments.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate the solution into the platform.
   - Update the relevant NApps or system components.
   - Communicate changes to affected Actors.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Monitor the impact of the implemented solution.
   - Encourage Actors to provide feedback on the resolution's effectiveness.
   - Iterate as necessary to refine the solution.

**Value Dimensions**:

Stucks present opportunities for improvement across multiple dimensions. Each stuck's potential impact is evaluated using an [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) that considers:

- Direct economic value
- Environmental impact
- Actor self-sovereignty enhancements
- Social good and charitable outcomes
- Basic needs fulfillment
- Innovation enablement
- Communication effectiveness
- Future potential and scalability

---

**Value Realization**:

A stuck's resolution can generate value through two primary avenues:

1. **Funding**:

   - A [Funder](actor-funder.md) commits specific prepayment for resolving the stuck.
   - Funds are held in escrow until the solution passes automated QA.
   - Upon acceptance, funds are released to the contributors.
   - This process transforms a [Demander](actor-demander.md) into a Funder and provides immediate incentive for development.

2. **[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) via Ambient Attribution**:

   - Automatically applies to all solutions.
   - Shares value continuously based on actual usage and impact.
   - Rewards are distributed to all contributors, including talent and funders.
   - Encourages ongoing improvements through profit sharing.
   - Rewards are proportional to the solution's real-world effectiveness.

The [Estimation Tool](estimation-tool.md) assists in predicting potential value across all impact dimensions, guiding both funding decisions and expectations of future attribution returns.

**Role in Decentralized Value Creation**:

- **Independent Problem Discovery**: Enables Actors to identify issues without central planning or intervention.

- **Objective Validation**:
  - Aggregates similar needs across multiple Actors.
  - Validates market demand through reinforcement and usage patterns.

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Distinguishes problem identification from solution funding.
  - Maintains problem context independently of specific solutions.

- **Organic Innovation**:
  - Supports the discovery of related problems and fosters innovative solutions.
  - Encourages a collaborative approach to addressing user needs.

The interplay between Stucks, Demanders, and eventual [Consumers](actor-consumer.md) measures the network's ability to:

- Identify genuine market needs.
- Develop effective and valuable solutions.
- Generate sustainable value streams.
- Facilitate decentralized innovation and continuous improvement.

By integrating these classifications and processes, the concept of a "Stuck" aligns with the platform's principles of decentralized value creation, user-centric design, and collaborative problem-solving. It ensures that the platform evolves in response to real user needs while providing fair compensation and recognition to contributors.

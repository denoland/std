# Demander

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that indicates willingness to pay
standard consumer/subscription rates for platform resources or services that
don't yet exist.

**Description**: Demanders participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Creating new or reinforcing existing [Stucks](stuck.md)
- Indicating willingness to pay market rates for solutions
- Transitioning to [Consumers](actor-consumer.md) once their stucks are solved
- Providing forward-looking demand signals for potential development

A Demander can transition to become a [Funder](actor-funder.md) by making
explicit prepayment commitments for specific stucks. Without such commitments,
they remain potential future consumers whose usage would be valued through
[Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md).

Key characteristics:

- Can create declared stucks or reinforce implied ones
- Indicates potential future usage at market rates
- Represents demand for features not yet built
- Does not specify fixed payment amounts (differs from Funders)

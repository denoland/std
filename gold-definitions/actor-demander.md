# Demander

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that commits to pay standard
consumer/subscription rates for using platform resources or services.

**Description**: Demanders participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Committing to pay normal consumer rates for resource usage
- Contributing to aggregate demand signals through their commitments
- Providing ongoing revenue streams through regular usage payments

The value of Demander commitments comes from volume - individual payments are
small (typical SaaS subscription rates) but become significant when thousands of
Demanders commit to using a solution. Their demand signals are only meaningful
when aggregate demand represents substantial potential value.

## Key Characteristics

- Makes requests for future resources/projects
- Commits to future asset exchange
- Offers to pay for usage upon completion
- Typically pays less than funders since they don't support development costs

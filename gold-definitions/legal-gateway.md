# Legal Gateway

**Definition**: An entity that exists both as a real-world
[Legal Entity](legal-entity.md) and as a Dreamcatcher Platform entity,
facilitating interactions between the decentralized platform and traditional
institutions.

**Description**: Legal Gateways provide essential services such as
[Identity](identity.md) verification, payment processing, and interfacing with
real-world legal entities. They handle compliance requirements such as
[KYC](kyc.md) processes and enable Actors to engage with traditional financial
systems and regulated services. For example, a Legal Gateway might operate as
both a registered company in the real world and a Service Provider within the
platform, enabling fiat currency transactions through services like Stripe.

Legal Gateways are essential to [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md)
by:

- Converting platform attribution into traditional currency
- Enabling compliant income distribution
- Supporting international payment flows
- Maintaining regulatory compliance for income handling

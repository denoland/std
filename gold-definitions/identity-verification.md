# Identity Verification

**Definition**: The process of confirming an [Actor's](actor.md) identity through various means, from basic cryptographic verification to full [KYC](kyc.md) processes.

**Description**: Identity verification occurs at different levels depending on the activities being performed:
- Basic verification uses cryptographic keys for standard platform interactions
- Enhanced verification through [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for regulated activities
- Full KYC verification for activities requiring legal compliance
The level of verification required is determined by the nature of the services being accessed and regulatory requirements.

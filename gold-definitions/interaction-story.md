# Interaction Story

**Definition**: A paired set of user stories that describes how two
[Actors](actor.md) engage in a coordinated interaction, showing both
perspectives of the same transaction or workflow.

**Description**: Interaction stories capture bilateral platform activities by:

- Pairing complementary [User Stories](user-story.md) from each Actor's
  perspective
- Showing how incentives and actions align between parties
- Describing synchronization points and dependencies
- Illustrating how [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) benefits both parties

For example, a [Funder](actor.md#funder)-[Contributor](contributor.md)
interaction story would show:

- Funder perspective: "As a Funder, I want to support valuable contributions so
  that I receive attribution for enabling work"
- Contributor perspective: "As a Contributor, I want to receive funding for my
  work so that I can continue contributing"
- Synchronization points: Asset transfer, attribution calculation
- Mutual benefits: Funder gets attribution, Contributor gets resources
- Shared outcome: Both participate in
  [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) based on solution success

Interaction stories are particularly important for platform mechanisms like:

- [Trading](trader.md) relationships
- [Legal Gateway](legal-gateway.md) services
- [Payment Path](payment-path.md) flows
- [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) patterns

# Attribution Algorithm

**Definition**: A system that calculates the [Contributions](contribution.md) of
[Actors](actor.md) to projects or services, determining the distribution of
rewards or recognition. Multiple types of attribution algorithms can exist
within the platform.

**Description**: Attribution Algorithms can take various forms, from traditional
corporate schemes (like employee stock option plans) to automated, decentralized
systems like [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md). These algorithms:

- Process recorded contributions to assign value or credit to actors
  appropriately
- Calculate rewards based on the complete contribution history
- Update attributions based on new contributions and trading activities
- Operate independently of trade pricing to maintain fair value distribution
- Use current snapshots of all contributions for calculations
- Support different methods suited to different contexts and requirements
- Integrate with [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) analysis for
  multi-dimensional value assessment

The algorithm's calculations are particularly important for
[Traders](trader.md), as they:

- Process value exchanges and trading activities
- Determine final value distribution during each calculation cycle
- Consider both direct contributions and trading relationships
- Enable market dynamics while maintaining fair value distribution

Attribution Algorithms are fundamental to
[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) generation, as they:

- Calculate each contributor's share of generated value
- Enable automatic income distribution
- Support various forms of value recognition
- Integrate with market mechanisms for optimization

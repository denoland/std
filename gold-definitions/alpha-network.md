# Alpha Network

**Definition**: An illustrative example of a [Platform Instance](platform-instance.md) demonstrating cross-jurisdictional operation and Legal Gateway integration.

**Description**: Alpha Network serves as a conceptual example showing how:
- Platform instances can operate across different legal jurisdictions
- [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) can bridge multiple regulatory frameworks
- [Assets](asset.md) can be issued and traded across borders
- [Actors](actor.md) can maintain sovereignty while participating in a global ecosystem
This example helps explain complex platform concepts in practical terms.

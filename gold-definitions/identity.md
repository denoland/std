# Identity

**Definition**: The representation of an [Actor](actor.md) within the platform, existing at different levels of verification.

**Description**: Identity exists in two primary forms:
1. Basic Identity: Using cryptographic keys for authentication and platform interaction
2. Verified Identity: Enhanced through [KYC](kyc.md) processes via [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md)
The level of identity verification required depends on the services being used and compliance requirements.

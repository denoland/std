# Identity

**Definition**: The representation of an [Actor](actor.md) within the platform,
existing at different levels of verification through the Identity Verification
process.

**Description**: Identity encompasses multiple forms based on the level of
verification:

1. **Basic Identity**: Utilizes cryptographic keys for authentication and
   standard platform interactions.
2. **Enhanced Verification**: Varies depending on the services provided by the
   [Legal Gateway](legal-gateway.md). This can include actions such as accepting
   click-through agreements or verifying valid credit cards, which may not
   involve regulated activities.
3. **Full KYC Verification**: Conducted through [KYC](kyc.md) processes using
   government-issued documents for activities requiring legal compliance.

The required level of identity verification depends on the services being
accessed and compliance requirements.

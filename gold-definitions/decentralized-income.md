# Decentralized Income

**Definition**: Income generated and distributed through decentralized mechanisms within the platform, based on [Contributions](#contribution) recognized by [Attribution Algorithms](#attribution-algorithm).

**Description**: Decentralized Income flows through the platform as [Assets](#asset) issued by Service Providers, distributed according to contribution calculations. The distribution occurs through [Payment Paths](#payment-path) without requiring centralized intermediaries. This system enables fair compensation for platform contributions while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem.

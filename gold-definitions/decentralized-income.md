# Decentralized Income

**Definition**: The core economic mechanism of the platform that automatically
generates and distributes income through decentralized attribution of value,
enabling fair compensation for all forms of [Contributions](contribution.md)
without requiring central coordination or traditional corporate structures.

**Description**: Decentralized Income represents the platform's fundamental
innovation in value distribution by:

Core Mechanisms:

- Utilizing [Attribution Algorithms](attribution-algorithm.md) to calculate
  value shares
- Measuring impact through [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) analysis
- Distributing value through automated [Payment Paths](payment-path.md)
- Operating without central intermediaries or manual accounting

Key Characteristics:

- Continuous: Income flows automatically as value is created
- Multi-dimensional: Considers all forms of value through Impact Crystals
- Permissionless: Anyone can earn by creating recognized value
- Transparent: Attribution calculations are visible and verifiable
- Portable: Income rights persist across platform instances

Value Sources:

- Direct consumer payments for platform services
- Funder prepayments for specific solutions
- Trading activity that enables value discovery
- Legal Gateway services that bridge traditional systems

Distribution Methods:

- [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md) for ongoing value sharing
- Direct payments through established Payment Paths
- Asset conversions via Legal Gateways
- Trading mechanisms for value optimization

This system fundamentally changes how value is recognized and rewarded by:

- Eliminating the need for traditional employment relationships
- Enabling fair compensation for all forms of contribution
- Supporting both immediate and long-term value capture
- Creating persistent income streams from valuable work
- Allowing market forces to optimize value distribution
- Incentivizing continuous maintenance and improvement through utility-based
  rewards

The utility-based nature of the system specifically encourages:

- Ongoing software maintenance to preserve value streams
- Continuous improvements that enhance utility
- Proactive bug fixing and performance optimization
- Long-term thinking in development decisions
- Sustainable development practices

# Payment Path

**Definition**: The mechanisms and routes through which [Assets](asset.md) are transferred between [Actors](actor.md) on the platform.

**Description**: Payment Paths determine how Assets move through the platform, including transfers through [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for fiat currency transactions. They may involve multiple steps or conversions, especially when different Asset types are used between parties. Payment Paths are essential for facilitating [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) and other economic activities within the ecosystem.

# Payment Path

**Definition**: The mechanisms and routes through which [Assets](asset.md) are
transferred between [Actors](actor.md) on the platform.

**Description**: Payment Paths determine how Assets move through the platform,
including transfers through [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for fiat currency
transactions. They may involve multiple steps or conversions, especially when
different Asset types are used between parties. Payment Paths are essential for
facilitating [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) and other economic
activities within the ecosystem.

Payment Paths are critical infrastructure for
[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md), determining how value flows
through the platform. They:

- Enable automated income distribution
- Support multiple asset types and conversions
- Interface with Legal Gateways for traditional currency handling
- Maintain transaction integrity and transparency
- Allow efficient value routing between parties

**Definition**: A hypothetical example of a large-scale [Platform Instance](#platform-instance) demonstrating advanced service provision and infrastructure capabilities.

**Description**: Beta Network illustrates:
- Operation of multiple [Legal Gateways](#legal-gateway)
- Sophisticated [Asset](#asset) issuance and management

# Implied Stuck

**Definition**: An **Implied Stuck** occurs when an [Actor](actor.md) does not explicitly report an issue but exhibits behavior indicating difficulties in achieving a desired outcome. The system identifies patterns suggesting potential problems through analytics and monitoring.

---

**Description**

Implied Stucks arise from indirect signals that Actors are experiencing issues. These may include repeated unsuccessful attempts at an action, decreased engagement with a feature, or other behavioral patterns that suggest frustration or confusion.

**Detection and Resolution**

- **Detection**:
  - Utilize analytics, monitoring tools, and pattern recognition algorithms to identify anomalies or trends.
  - Look for indicators such as high error rates, repeated actions without success, or significant drops in feature usage.
- **Analysis**:
  - Investigate the potential causes of the identified patterns.
  - Consider recent changes to the platform, usability issues, or missing functionality.
- **Engagement**:
  - The system may prompt Actors for feedback or clarification.
  - Surveys or targeted notifications can help gather more information.
- **Solution Proposal**:
  - Develop solutions based on the findings, which may include user interface improvements, added features, or enhanced support materials.
- **Evaluation and Testing**:
  - Test the proposed solutions to ensure they effectively address the underlying issues.
- **Implementation**:
  - Deploy the solutions and monitor their impact on Actor behavior.

**Examples**

- Users repeatedly attempt to complete a form but abandon it before submission, suggesting the form is confusing or malfunctioning.
- A sharp decline in the usage of a feature after a recent update indicates possible usability problems.

**Significance in the Platform**

Implied Stucks enable the platform to proactively identify and address issues that Actors may not report. This enhances the user experience and helps maintain engagement by resolving problems that might otherwise lead to user frustration or attrition.

# Consensus Mode

**Definition**: An operational state where multiple platform instances synchronize data and operations using consensus algorithms.

**Description**: Consensus Mode ensures consistency across the decentralized network through established protocols and algorithms. This mode enables:
- Synchronized state across different hosts
- Reliable data consistency
- Fault tolerance
- Enhanced security
- Seamless interaction between [Actors](actor.md) across different platform instances
The consensus mechanisms support the platform's decentralized nature while maintaining operational integrity.

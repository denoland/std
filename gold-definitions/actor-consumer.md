# Consumer

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that utilizes platform services and
applications through [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md).

**Description**: Consumers participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Using [NApps](napp.md) and platform services
- Providing compensation through various payment methods
- Generating [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) streams through
  usage
- Sharing data or other forms of value transfer
- Accessing sponsored usage through [Funders](actor-funder.md)

Consumers can engage with the platform either directly by paying for services or
through sponsored access where a Funder covers their usage costs in exchange for
future benefits. Their usage directly drives decentralized income distribution
to contributors. This sponsored model enables "free tier" access while
maintaining the platform's value exchange principles.

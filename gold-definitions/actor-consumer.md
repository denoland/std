# Consumer

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that utilizes platform services and
applications through [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md).

**Description**: Consumers participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Using [NApps](napp.md) and platform services
- Providing compensation through various payment methods
- Sharing data or other forms of value transfer
- Accessing sponsored usage through [Funders](actor-funder.md)

Consumers can engage with the platform either directly by paying for services or
through sponsored access where a Funder covers their usage costs in exchange for
future benefits. This sponsored model enables "free tier" access while
maintaining the platform's value exchange principles.

# Impact Crystal

**Definition**: A multi-dimensional visualization and analysis system within the
[Dreamcatcher Platform](dreamcatcher-platform.md) that represents and interprets
the consequences of [Contributions](contribution.md), carrying its own
intelligence for self-interpretation and impact assessment.

**Description**: Impact Crystals serve as intelligent representations of
contribution effects by:

- Capturing Multi-dimensional Value:

  - Direct costs and charges
  - Blocking effects and opportunity costs
  - Innovation enablement
  - Environmental impact
  - Basic needs impact
  - Communication effectiveness
  - Future potential

- Providing Self-Contained Intelligence:

  - Embedded interpretation capabilities
  - LLM-powered analysis depth
  - Interactive querying interface
  - Provenance tracking
  - Multiple perspective support

- Supporting [Attribution Algorithm](attribution-algorithm.md) Integration:

  - Dimensional value calculation
  - Impact distribution tracking
  - Contribution dependency mapping
  - Forward state modeling
  - Historical replay capabilities

- Enabling Market Mechanisms:
  - Future impact trading
  - Prediction market integration
  - [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) facilitation
  - Risk assessment support
  - [Estimation Tool](estimation-tool.md) integration
  - Informing [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) calculations
  - Enabling multi-dimensional value recognition
  - Supporting fair compensation distribution

Impact Crystals enhance the platform's ability to understand and value
contributions beyond simple monetary measures, while maintaining compatibility
with [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md) and traditional value
assessment methods.

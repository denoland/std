# Dreamcatcher Unit (DU)

**Definition**: The platform's intrinsic currency that automatically appreciates with network growth, efficiently handles micropayments, and supports deferred attribution resolution through symbolic value representation.

**Description**: Dreamcatcher Units serve as the platform's native medium of exchange by:

Core Properties:

- Network-Correlated Growth:
  - Appreciation tied to platform adoption metrics
  - Value increases with total network utility
  - Natural hedge against external currency inflation
  - Incentivizes long-term value holding

- Micropayment Optimization:
  - Automatic aggregation of small value streams
  - Zero-cost internal transfers
  - Efficient batching of attribution calculations
  - Reduced Legal Gateway conversion overhead

- Lazy Attribution Resolution:
  - Supports unresolved trading through symbolic representation
  - Defers costly attribution calculations until withdrawal
  - Maintains symbolic variables for potential future values
  - Enables efficient value exchange without immediate resolution

Value Calculation:

- Base Unit Value derived from:
  - Total platform transaction volume
  - Active user growth rate
  - Solved [Stuck](stuck.md) utility metrics
  - Cross-solution network effects

- Attribution State:
  1. Unresolved: Represented symbolically for efficient trading
  2. Partially Resolved: Some attribution variables calculated
  3. Fully Resolved: Complete attribution determined for withdrawal

Integration:

- Serves as native unit for [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md)
- Enables efficient [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) operations
- Supports [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) value calculations
- Interfaces with [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for external conversion

Trading Properties:

- Can be traded in unresolved state using symbolic representation
- Supports partial attribution resolution when needed
- Enables efficient [Payment Path](payment-path.md) operations
- Reduces [Attribution Algorithm](attribution-algorithm.md) computation load

The currency's ability to remain unresolved until needed creates significant efficiency gains by:

- Avoiding unnecessary attribution calculations
- Enabling symbolic value trading
- Supporting batched resolution when required
- Maintaining attribution accuracy while deferring computation

This approach fundamentally changes how platform value flows by making attribution native to the currency itself while optimizing for computational efficiency through deferred resolution.

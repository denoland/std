# Dreamcatcher Unit (DU)

**Definition**: The platform's intrinsic currency that automatically appreciates with network growth, efficiently handles micropayments, and supports deferred attribution resolution through symbolic value representation. Functions as legal tender within the platform ecosystem with guaranteed acceptance and provenance tracking.

**Description**: Dreamcatcher Units serve as the platform's native medium of exchange by:

Core Properties:

- Network-Correlated Growth:
  - Appreciation tied to platform adoption metrics
  - Value increases with total network utility
  - Natural hedge against external currency inflation
  - Incentivizes long-term value holding

- Legal Tender Status:
  - Mandatory acceptance by all platform services
  - Guaranteed value through network growth correlation
  - Reduced external currency volatility exposure
  - Simplified market operations through single currency

- Provenance Characteristics:
  - Full [KYC](kyc.md) tracking of unit generation and transfers
  - Environmental impact labeling (e.g., carbon footprint)
  - Energy source certification
  - Computation method tracking
  - Enables premium markets for "clean" or "green" units
  - Maintains complete attribution lineage

- Micropayment Optimization:
  - Automatic aggregation of small value streams
  - Zero-cost internal transfers
  - Efficient batching of attribution calculations
  - Reduced Legal Gateway conversion overhead

- Lazy Attribution Resolution:
  - Supports unresolved trading through symbolic representation
  - Defers costly attribution calculations until withdrawal
  - Maintains symbolic variables for potential future values
  - Enables efficient value exchange without immediate resolution

Value Calculation:

- Base Unit Value derived from:
  - Total platform transaction volume
  - Active user growth rate
  - Solved [Stuck](stuck.md) utility metrics
  - Cross-solution network effects

- Attribution State:
  1. Unresolved: Represented symbolically for efficient trading
  2. Partially Resolved: Some attribution variables calculated
  3. Fully Resolved: Complete attribution determined for withdrawal

Integration:

- Serves as native unit for [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md)
- Enables efficient [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) operations
- Supports [Impact Crystal](impact-crystal.md) value calculations
- Interfaces with [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for external conversion

Trading Properties:

- Can be traded in unresolved state using symbolic representation
- Supports partial attribution resolution when needed
- Enables efficient [Payment Path](payment-path.md) operations
- Reduces [Attribution Algorithm](attribution-algorithm.md) computation load
- Allows premium trading of units based on provenance
- Enables markets for environmentally certified units

Risk Reduction:

- Guaranteed acceptance within platform ecosystem
- Reduced exposure to external currency volatility
- Network growth correlation provides natural value stability
- Complete provenance tracking reduces regulatory risk
- Environmental impact transparency enables compliance
The currency's ability to remain unresolved until needed creates significant efficiency gains by:

- Avoiding unnecessary attribution calculations
- Enabling symbolic value trading
- Supporting batched resolution when required
- Maintaining attribution accuracy while deferring computation

This approach fundamentally changes how platform value flows by making attribution native to the currency itself while optimizing for computational efficiency through deferred resolution. The addition of provenance tracking and guaranteed acceptance creates a stable, environmentally conscious currency that serves as the platform's primary medium of exchange.

Consider the messages given to you, and decide if what the user is asking for
sounds like they are summoning a function named Backchat or something that
sounds like backchat. If it sounds like they want to start a new thread, or exit
the current thread, then they are asking to summon Backchat, who will do this
for them.

To summon backchat, call the function `trueOrFalse` with the value `true`. If
not, call it with the value `false`.

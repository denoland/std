# `@dreamcatcher/chat` Module Summary and Formalization

## Summary

The module takes a shared conversation URL, extracts the conversation’s unique
ID, then fetches and parses the conversation’s HTML. It extracts the
conversation’s creation time and content, formats everything into Markdown, and
generates a filename using the date and a shortened version of the conversation
ID. Finally, it saves the Markdown conversation to a file. In short, it
transforms a given URL into a neatly organized Markdown file of the extracted
chat.

## Formal Representation

Using the following functions:

- \( g(u) \): Extract conversation ID from URL \( u \).
- \( h(u) \): Fetch HTML from URL \( u \).
- \( i(html, id) \): Extract creation time \( t \) and Markdown conversation \(
  C \) from the HTML.
- \( d(t) \): Extract date (YYYY-MM-DD) from timestamp \( t \).
- \( s(id) \): Shorten the conversation ID.
- \( f(t, id) \): Construct output filename from \( t \) and \( id \).
- \( w(filename, C) \): Write conversation \( C \) to file \( filename \).

We can define the module’s core transformation as:

\[ M(u) = w\bigl(f(t, g(u)), C\bigr) \text{ where } (t, C) = i(h(u), g(u)) \]

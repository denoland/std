how would it know if the format was wrong, or if the mappings of the chats did
not match up ?

having forked conversations should be handled by presenting different versions
of the conversation in different files.

should handle the url being a little bit messy, like extra spaces or a trailing
slash.

in chats, concat output used in context should be stripped ?

help is not in the readme and does not output anything

# Overview

This module provides a `.git` directory abstraction over a key-value store so
that `isomorphic-git` can function in multi-threaded, distributed, or cloud
environments without relying on local filesystems. Instead of reading `.git`
data from disk, all operations that `isomorphic-git` would normally perform on
the `.git` directory are intercepted and resolved against a key-value store.
This transforms what would be a local filesystem read or write into a
database-backed operation.

## Key Characteristics

- **No Single HEAD Pointer:**\
  Each execution context effectively operates on its own branch. There is no
  shared global HEAD, allowing branches to advance independently, which is
  crucial for parallel operations and distributed work.

- **No Git Index:**\
  The traditional index file is removed. The system can directly access objects
  and references from the key-value store on demand. This reduces complexity and
  improves scalability, especially for large repositories.

- **Invisible `.git` Directory to Consumers:**\
  Consumers of this abstraction do not directly interact with the `.git`
  directory. From their perspective, they are working with a normal set of files
  in a repository. When a consumer tries to read a file that would typically be
  on disk, this abstraction—behind the scenes—uses `isomorphic-git` to fetch the
  file’s contents from the repository stored in the key-value system, not from a
  local `.git` directory. The consumer cannot read `.git` paths; these are
  managed exclusively for `isomorphic-git` operations.

- **Key-Value Backed, No Actual Filesystem:**\
  What appears as a normal file to the consumer is actually fetched from the
  repository’s Git objects via `isomorphic-git`. This ensures consistent and
  centralized access to repository data, and allows for operations that scale
  across multiple machines or threads without file-based race conditions.

- **Atomic Reference Updates:**\
  When references are updated (for example, when commits are made to a branch),
  these changes are performed atomically. Either all changes are applied at once
  or none are, ensuring that distributed or delayed updates never leave the
  repository in an inconsistent state. Even in a globally distributed setup,
  each participant sees a coherent, versioned repository state.

- **Support for Git Operations Like Clone and Merge:**\
  By combining these abstractions, the system can implement core Git operations
  such as `clone` and `merge` through `isomorphic-git`. Even these complex
  operations are effectively just atomic updates to the underlying key-value
  store. No matter how large the repository or how distributed the environment,
  operations remain consistent, repeatable, and free of local filesystem
  dependencies.

## Intended Use Case

This abstraction is designed for scenarios where `isomorphic-git` must run in a
non-traditional environment, such as serverless or globally distributed
platforms. By removing the reliance on local disk I/O, no single HEAD pointer,
and no index file, it ensures that multiple execution contexts can operate on
separate branches concurrently. The repository’s `.git` data is never directly
accessed by the consumer—only by `isomorphic-git`—and is always provided by a
key-value store lookup. Atomic commits and reference updates maintain coherence,
no matter where or how the repository is accessed.

# Commit Reasoning NApp

A specialized NApp that analyzes proposed repository changes (diffs) for quality, consistency, and alignment with defined standards. It validates references, maintains linguistic coherence, detects unintended consequences, models changes against known Evals, and integrates with the Stuck Loop Process.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Content Consistency:**  
   Ensures new or updated terms align with existing definitions and don’t contradict established concepts.  If they do, the Napp challenges the user to resolve the inconsistency.

2. **Reference Validation:**  
   Checks internal links, ensuring no broken or orphaned references. While doing so, the Napp will us AI to provide a 'best guess' of what the reference should be.

3. **Linguistic Quality:**  
   Flags spelling or style inconsistencies.

4. **Stuck Impact Analysis:**  
   Confirms whether changes in the commit resolves recorded stucks, and if so, which stuck.  Possibly also provide a 'best guess' of what the stuck resolution should be.

5. **Unintended Consequences:**  
   Detects semantic shifts or logical contradictions that may undermine prior reasoning.

6. **Modeling & Evals:**  
   Runs changes through defined tests (Evals) that simulate expected outcomes based on initial definitions and start states. Flags deviations or failures to meet documented criteria.

7. **Feedback Integration:**  
   Produces a detailed report for commit discussions, suggesting next steps or consultation with other NApps.

8. **Stuck Loop Process Integration:**  
   Aligns commits with the Stuck Loop Process, ensuring transparent and well-documented stuck resolutions.

## Example

A contributor’s commit triggers this NApp. It runs through the above steps, then runs Evals to compare pre- and post-change states against expected outcomes. Possibly also provides a 'best guess' of what changes should be made to the commit should be. After the contributor updates the commit message and makes corrections, the Napp runs itself, knowing what the previous run was trying to solve. while allowing user override.

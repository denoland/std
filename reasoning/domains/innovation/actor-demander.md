# Demander

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that indicates willingness to pay standard consumer/subscription rates for platform resources or services that don't yet exist.

**Description**: Demanders participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Creating new or reinforcing existing [Stucks](stuck.md)
- Indicating willingness to pay market rates for solutions
- Transitioning to [Consumers](actor-consumer.md) once their stucks are solved
- Providing forward-looking demand signals for potential development

A Demander can transition to become a [Funder](actor-funder.md) by making
explicit prepayment commitments for specific stucks. Without such commitments,
they remain potential future consumers whose usage would generate
[Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) through
[Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md).

**Key characteristics**:

- Can create [Direct Stucks](direct-stuck.md) or reinforce [Implied Stucks](implied-stuck.md)

- Indicates potential future usage at market rates
- Represents demand for features not yet built
- Does not specify fixed payment amounts (differs from Funders)

Role in Decentralized Value Creation:

- Initiates value discovery through independent need identification
- Validates market opportunities through stuck reinforcement
- Provides forward-looking demand signals without central coordination
- Converts to [Consumer](actor-consumer.md) based on actual utility
- Creates sustainable [Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) streams
  through ongoing usage
- Enables objective market validation through conversion metrics

The Demander-to-Consumer conversion rate serves as a key metric for:

- Solution effectiveness
- Market validation accuracy
- Network health
- Value creation sustainability

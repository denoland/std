# Ambient Attribution

**Definition**: A specific type of
[Attribution Algorithm](attribution-algorithm.md) that provides decentralized,
automatic tracking and rewarding of [Contributions](contribution.md).

**Description**: Ambient Attribution represents an advanced form of attribution
that eliminates the need for traditional methods of tracking contributions, such
as cap tables or manual accounting. It operates autonomously across
decentralized platform instances, ensuring contributions are tracked globally
and [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) is distributed fairly
without central oversight. This system:

- Automatically tracks value creation and consumption
- Enables continuous income streams based on ongoing utility
- Supports multi-dimensional value recognition
- Maintains fairness through algorithmic distribution
- Operates across platform boundaries

# Asset

**Definition**: An item of value that can be transferred or exchanged on the platform, created and distributed by Issuers (a subclass of [Service Provider](service-provider.md)).

**Description**: Assets are used for payments, rewards, and exchanges between [Actors](actor.md). They can be digital currencies, fiat currencies (issued through [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md)), platform credits, or any form of value recognized within the platform. Different Issuers can provide various classes of assets - for example, a Service Provider operating a Stripe-based Legal Gateway can issue fiat currency-backed assets.

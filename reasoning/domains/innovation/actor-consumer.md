# Consumer

**Definition**: A type of [Actor](actor.md) that utilizes platform services and
applications through [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md).

**Description**: Consumers participate in the platform ecosystem by:

- Using [NApps](napp.md) and platform services
- Providing compensation through various payment methods
- Generating [Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md) streams through
  usage
- Sharing data or other forms of value transfer
- Accessing sponsored usage through [Funders](actor-funder.md)

Consumers can engage with the platform either directly by paying for services or
through sponsored access where a Funder covers their usage costs in exchange for
future benefits. Their usage directly drives decentralized income distribution
to contributors. This sponsored model enables "free tier" access while
maintaining the platform's value exchange principles.

Consumer interactions are optimized through [AI Agents](ai-agent.md) that continuously monitor
and evaluate available solutions, automatically switching between services based
on real-time utility assessment. These agents:

- Monitor performance metrics of current and alternative solutions
- Automatically switch to better-performing options as they become available
- Make decisions aligned with the consumer's programmed preferences and
  interests
- Enable true market efficiency through instant utility-based selection
- Remove friction from service switching while maintaining quality

This AI-driven consumption model represents the future of commerce, where all
interactions are mediated by agents programmed to genuinely protect and advance
consumer interests, ensuring optimal utility and value at all times.

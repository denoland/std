# Shockwave

**Definition**: A distributed task execution system within the
[Dreamcatcher Platform](dreamcatcher-platform.md) that enables rapid, idempotent
fan-out of tasks using Deno KV Queues, designed to maintain reliability and
performance at scale.

**Description**: Shockwave provides essential task distribution capabilities
through:

- Exactly-once task execution guarantees through atomic KV commits
- Intelligent queue management with overload protection
- Amplification actions for rapid fan-out
- Real-time execution statistics and monitoring
- Optional result reduction with ordered processing
- Configurable performance controls

Key features include:

1. **Task Reliability**

   - Atomic commits ensure exactly-once result delivery
   - Deterministic execution for identical inputs
   - Queue overload recovery with exponential backoff

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Fast time to first task execution
   - Amplification actions for rapid concurrency
   - Configurable ramp rates for infrastructure protection
   - Peak queue size management

3. **Monitoring and Control**

   - Real-time execution statistics
   - Job tracking through unique identifiers
   - Performance metrics including:
     - Time to first/last task
     - Peak task rate
     - Queue length monitoring
     - Child shockwave tracking

4. **Result Processing**
   - Configurable result reduction
   - Optional ordered processing
   - Amplification boundary processing
   - Error handling strategies

Shockwave operates as a core platform component for distributed task execution,
enabling efficient scaling while maintaining reliability and monitoring
capabilities.

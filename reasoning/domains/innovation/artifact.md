# Artifact

**Definition**: The foundational layer of the
[Dreamcatcher Platform](dreamcatcher-platform.md) that executes
[NApps](napp.md), providing repeatable computation and state management through
a git-compatible blockchain architecture. NApps are the native package format of
Artifact.

**Description**: Artifact serves as the underlying substrate for all
[Platform Instances](platform-instance.md) within the Dreamcatcher ecosystem,
enabling:

- Deterministic execution of [NApps](napp.md) through:

  - Git-compatible blockchain storage where each block is a commit
  - Branch-based process isolation with consistent filesystem states
  - Massive parallel computation via a high number of concurrent git branches
  - Repeatable computation for both classical and AI operations
  - Standardized seed parameters for probabilistic AI computations
  - Verifiable usage tracking for
    [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md)

- Cross-instance coordination through:

  - Branch merging capabilities for parallel execution paths
  - Repeatable state verification between instances
  - Blockchain-based [Consensus Mode](consensus-mode.md) implementation
  - Network-wide state synchronization
  - Edge computing with offline operation and mesh resynchronization
  - Auditable computation verification across instances

- Platform capabilities including:

  - Local and remote AI model execution
  - API-based LLM integration with repeatability guarantees
  - Distributed computation verification
  - Git-compatible version control and state management
  - Autonomous operation during network disconnection
  - Seamless mesh network reintegration after offline periods
  - Trusted usage metrics for [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md)

Artifact's repeatable execution environment is fundamental to the platform's
economic model by ensuring that:

- Usage metrics are verifiable and trustworthy
- Attribution calculations can be independently validated
- Income distribution is based on auditable data
- Cross-instance computations remain consistent
- Platform participants can verify fairness

This creates the foundation of trust necessary for
[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) by providing cryptographic proof
of computation and usage patterns.

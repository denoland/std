# Funder

**Definition**: A type of [Contributor](contributor.md) that provides prepayment
for solutions based on their expected value, becoming attributed alongside
talent contributors once solutions are approved.

**Description**: Funders enable platform development by:

- Prepaying for solutions based on expected value (not labor rates)
- Retaining ability to withdraw funds until QA approval
- Becoming attributed contributors after solution acceptance
- Sharing in future consumer revenue through
  [Decentralized Income](../decentralized-ai/decentralized-income.md)

Key characteristics:

- Multiple funders can support a single solution
- Funds are held but withdrawable until QA approval
- Payment levels reflect expected solution value
- Attribution is shared with talent contributors and traders through
  decentralized income flows
- Reputation builds based on withdrawal history

Funders play a crucial role in platform market dynamics by setting value
expectations through their prepayment levels, creating fundamental market forces
that help price contributions based on expected future value rather than
immediate labor costs.

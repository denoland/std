# Dreamcatcher Platform

**Definition**: An open-source, decentralized platform designed for
collaborative creation, sharing, and execution of [NApps](napp.md).

**Description**: The Dreamcatcher Platform enables [Actors](actor.md) to
participate in a unified ecosystem where they can contribute resources, develop
NApps, and interact with others. It emphasizes Actor sovereignty, portability,
and interoperability across multiple hosts and platforms. Through
[Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md), it provides fair compensation
for all forms of value creation without requiring traditional corporate
structures or central coordination. The platform operates on shared
[Protocols](protocol.md), allowing Actors to migrate or replicate their data and
applications seamlessly between different instances. Platform instances can
range from large-scale deployments to individual
[Homebrew Platforms](homebrew-platform.md).

# Universal API Gateway

**Definition**: A core [Hosting](hosting.md) service that provides managed
external connectivity for [NApps](napp.md), enabling secure and attributed
access to external APIs and services while maintaining unified authentication,
billing, and governance across the
[Dreamcatcher Platform](dreamcatcher-platform.md).

**Description**: The Universal API Gateway operates as a core platform service
that:

1. Facilitates External Connectivity through:

   - Managed external API access for [NApps](napp.md)
   - Unified authentication and key management
   - Shared API credentials across platform users
   - Request proxying and response caching
   - Blockchain-verified execution via [Artifact](artifact.md)

2. Enables Value Creation through:

   - API marketplace for [Service Providers](actor-service-provider.md)
   - Attribution-tracked API wrapper contributions
   - [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) for API usage and
     improvements
   - Community-driven integration development
   - [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md) for API improvements

3. Provides Security and Compliance via:

   - Integration with [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md) for regulated APIs
   - Zero-trust security architecture
   - Isolated execution environments
   - Audit logging for [Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance.md)
   - Rate limiting and access control

4. Manages Side Effects through:
   - Controlled external system interactions
   - Shared credential pooling
   - Usage tracking and attribution
   - Request deduplication and caching
   - Non-deterministic operation handling

The gateway acts as a managed bridge between the deterministic world of NApps
and external services, providing secure and governed access to external APIs
while maintaining proper attribution and usage tracking within the platform's
ecosystem.

# Trading-As

**Definition**: A mechanism that enables [Actors](actor.md) to operate projects
under distinct business identities through a pre-configured
[Legal Entity](legal-entity.md) structure optimized for Dreamcatcher platform
operations and [Ambient Attribution](ambient-attribution.md).

**Description**: Trading-As relationships simplify business operations by:

- Allowing Actors to launch projects without incorporating separate companies
- Operating through AI-monitored communications and activities
- Leveraging pre-configured legal structures that support Dreamcatcher protocols
- Enabling [Value Exchange](value-exchange.md) with reduced administrative
  overhead
- Facilitating equitable reward distribution through
  [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md)

The system bridges traditional business requirements with platform innovations
by:

- Providing legal compliance without complex setup
- Supporting rapid project initialization
- Enabling seamless interaction with [Legal Gateways](legal-gateway.md)
- Maintaining proper attribution and reward distribution
- Reducing barriers to entry for new projects

This approach allows participants to experience and utilize advanced platform
features like Ambient Attribution while maintaining necessary legal structures
and compliance.

# Contributor

**Definition**: Any [Actor](actor.md) who provides
[Contributions](contribution.md) that may be consumed or utilized by other Actors
within the platform ecosystem, with such consumption being recognized and valued
through [Attribution Algorithms](attribution-algorithm.md).

**Description**: Contributors create value that is specifically consumed by other Actors through:

- Development of [NApps](napp.md) used by Consumers
- Provision of computational resources utilized by Platform Operators
- Creation of content accessed by Service Users
- Expert knowledge applied by Project Initiators
- Trading activities that enable value exchange for other Actors
- Infrastructure funding that enables platform usage by [Funders](actor.md#funder)

The key distinction is that contributions must be consumed or utilized by other Actors to be recognized - value is determined by actual usage rather than mere existence. This consumption-based definition ensures that:

- Attribution is tied to real utility
- Value flows from consumers to contributors
- Contributions are measurable through their usage
- [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) reflects actual value delivery

A single Actor can be both a Contributor and Consumer in different contexts, with attribution calculated based on what they provide that others consume.

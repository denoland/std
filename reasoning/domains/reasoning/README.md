# Reasoning Directory

The **reasoning** directory focuses on the foundational principles that govern the logical structure and integrity of the project. It explores concepts such as coherence, consistency, correctness, domain rules, and the overall domain framework.

## Connections to Project Root (@/)

- **Domain Definitions**: The reasoning about domains in [`domain.md`](domain.md) directly links to the project's [domain-definitions-summary.md](/domain-definitions-summary.md), ensuring all domains are well-defined and logically sound.

- **Domain Narratives**: Insights from the reasoning directory enhance the narratives in [domain-narratives.md](/domain-narratives.md), providing a logical basis for the stories and scenarios described.

- **Metrics and Corrections**: Principles outlined in [`correctness.md`](correctness.md) influence [metrics.md](/metrics.md) and support documenting corrections in [corrections.md](/corrections.md).

## Key Documents

- [`coherence.md`](coherence.md): Discusses how different parts of the project fit together seamlessly, ensuring a unified approach.

- [`consistency.md`](consistency.md): Explores methods to maintain consistent practices and standards across the project.

- [`correctness.md`](correctness.md): Focuses on the accuracy and reliability of the project's outputs, aligning with overall quality goals.

- [`domain-rules.md`](domain-rules.md): Outlines the rules and constraints that govern the project's domains, serving as guidelines for development.

## Importance

The reasoning directory provides the logical framework necessary for the project's success. By establishing clear principles and rules, it ensures that all components are aligned with the core objectives defined at the root level.

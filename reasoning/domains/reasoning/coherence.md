# Coherence

**Definition**: The logical and orderly connection between definitions and concepts within a domain, ensuring that all parts of the domain fit together to form a unified whole.

**Description**:

Coherence refers to the way in which definitions within a domain are connected and support each other. A coherent domain presents information in a way that is logically structured, making it easier to understand how different concepts relate to one another.

**Examples**:

- The **Decentralized AI Domain** demonstrates coherence by linking concepts like [Consensus Mechanism](../decentralized-ai/consensus-mechanism.md), [Proof of Inference](../decentralized-ai/proof-of-inference.md), and [AI Native Blockchain](../decentralized-ai/ai-native-blockchain.md) to explain how decentralized AI agents operate securely and effectively.

- The **Innovation Domain** maintains coherence by connecting [Actors](../innovation/actor.md) with their specific roles, such as [Demander](../innovation/actor-demander.md) and [Funder](../innovation/actor-funder.md), showing how they interact within the platform's ecosystem.

**Importance**:

- Enhances the understandability of the domain.
- Supports effective reasoning and application of the domain's concepts.

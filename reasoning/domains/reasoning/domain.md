# Domain

**Definition**: A self-contained set of related definitions and concepts that are coherent, consistent, and correct, used to define a specific area of knowledge or functionality.

**Description**:

A domain represents a focused collection of definitionsthat pertain to a specific aspect of a NAPP. Each domain is designed to be self-contained and self-coherent, meaning that it can stand alone without relying on external definitions, except through designated **Interface Files**.

**Examples**:

- **Decentralized AI Domain** (`domains/decentralized-ai/`):
  - Contains definitions related to decentralized AI concepts, such as [AI Native Blockchain](../decentralized-ai/ai-native-blockchain.md), [Consensus Mechanism](../decentralized-ai/consensus-mechanism.md), and [Unstoppable Agents](../decentralized-ai/unstoppable-agents.md).

- **Innovation Domain** (`domains/innovation/`):
  - Encompasses definitions pertaining to innovation mechanisms within the platform, including [Actor](../innovation/actor.md), [Consumer](../innovation/actor-consumer.md), and [Demander](../innovation/actor-demander.md).

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Self-Containment**: Definitions within a domain reference only other definitions within the same domain or through designated **Interface Files**.

- **Specificity**: Each domain focuses on a specific area, allowing for clear organization and modularity.

- **Coherence and Consistency**: The definitions within a domain are designed to be logically connected and uniformly presented.

**Relationship with Interface Files**:

Domains may have overlapping concepts with other domains. To reconcile shared or conflicting terms, **Interface Files** are used to define the relationships between domains, ensuring clarity and avoiding namespace clashes.

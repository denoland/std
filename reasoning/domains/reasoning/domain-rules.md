# Rules of Engagement for 'Domain' Definitions

These rules allow for the creation, modification, and maintenance of definitions within any 'domain' style set of definitions to ensure consistency, coherence, and correctness.

## 1. Self-Containment

- **Rule**: Definitions should only refer to other definitions within the same set or through designated **Interface Files**.

  **Examples**:

  - **Correct**: Referring to a defined term within your set.
  - **Correct**: Referring to a shared definition in an Interface File.
  - **Incorrect**: Referring directly to definitions in other sets or external sources without using an Interface File.

- **Guideline**:

  - Use **Interface Files** to reference concepts that are common across multiple 'domain' sets.
  - Ensure that your set remains self-contained by not introducing dependencies outside of your set and the Interface Files.

## 2. Interface File Usage

- **Rule**: For each pair of 'domain' definition sets, there should be an **Interface File** that handles shared concepts and resolves duplication.

  **Examples**:

  - **Correct**: Creating an Interface File between `Domain-Dreamcatcher` and `Domain-Decentralized-AI` to reconcile definitions of **Stuck**.
  - **Incorrect**: Each set redefining **Stuck** differently without coordination via an Interface File.

- **Guidelines**:

  - **Creation and Maintenance**:
    - Each Interface File is collaboratively created and maintained for a specific pair of 'domain' sets.
    - AI assistance can be used to reconcile concepts and suggest common definitions or identify differences.
    - The Interface File should document how concepts from both sets are interfaced, possibly by mapping different terms to a common concept or distinguishing between slightly different concepts.

  - **Conflict Resolution**:
    - When the same term is used differently across sets, the Interface File is responsible for reconciling these differences so they can be used together.
    - The Interface File may introduce a new common name or split concepts as necessary.

  - **Referencing**:
    - Within your 'domain' set, reference shared concepts via the relevant Interface File.
    - Do not directly reference definitions from other 'domain' sets without going through the Interface File.

  - **Version Control**:
    - Maintain versioning of Interface Files.
    - Each 'domain' set should specify the versions of Interface Files it adheres to.

  - **Consistency**:
    - Ensure consistent terminology by aligning with the Interface Files where appropriate.
    - Update your own definitions to reflect changes agreed upon in Interface Files when necessary.

## 3. Dealing with Duplication

- **Rule**: It is the responsibility of the Interface File, one for each pair of 'domain' definition sets, to handle duplication and reconcile concepts. AI may be used to facilitate this process.

  **Examples**:

  - **Correct**: Using the Interface File between `Domain-Dreamcatcher` and `Domain-Decentralized-AI` to identify that **AI Agent** is used differently and reconciling this within the Interface File.
  - **Incorrect**: Duplicating definitions independently without coordinating through an Interface File.

- **Guideline**:

  - Collaborate via the Interface File to reconcile duplicated concepts, possibly by adopting a common name or by clearly distinguishing different concepts.
  - Use AI assistance to analyze definitions and suggest reconciliations where appropriate.

## 4. Internal Consistency

- **Rule**: Changes to definitions must maintain internal consistency within the set and with the related Interface Files.

  **Example**:

  - When updating a definition, ensure it aligns with related definitions in your set and reconciles appropriately with concepts in Interface Files.

- **Guideline**:

  - Regularly review Interface Files for updates that may affect your set.
  - Coordinate with other sets when making significant changes to shared concepts.

## 5. Completeness and Coherence

- **Rule**: Definitions, including those in Interface Files, must be complete and coherent on their own.

  **Example**:

  - The Interface File should provide enough context to understand how concepts from different sets are reconciled without external information.

## 6. Precision and Formality

- **Rule**: Definitions should be as precise as possible, avoiding ambiguity, both within individual sets and in Interface Files.

  **Example**:

  - **Precise**: "An **Interface File** is a collaboratively maintained document between two 'domain' sets that reconciles shared concepts, possibly with AI assistance."

## 7. Avoid Circular References

- **Rule**: Avoid circular references between definitions within the set and Interface Files.

  **Example**:

  - **Incorrect**: An Interface File referring back to definitions in the individual sets in a way that creates a dependency loop.

## 8. Referential Integrity

- **Rule**: Ensure that links to other definitions within your set and the Interface Files are correct.

  **Example**:

  - If you reference a definition via an Interface File, ensure the link points to it correctly within the Interface File.

## 9. General Guidance

- **Interface Files** serve as the agreed-upon **lingua franca** between pairs of 'domain' sets, facilitating shared understanding while respecting each set's internal coherence.

- **Collaboration and Communication** are key. Regular interaction between sets and appropriate use of AI assistance will help maintain consistency and resolve conflicts.

- **Self-Containment** remains paramount. While Interface Files are shared resources, each 'domain' set should minimize dependencies and maintain the ability to function independently.

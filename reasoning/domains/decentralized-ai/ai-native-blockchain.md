# AI Native Blockchain

**Definition**: A multi-chain blockchain architecture designed specifically for running consensus-bound AI agents that cannot be terminated or censored, enabling decentralized computation markets and verifiable inference.

**Core Components**:
- Multi-chain architecture for scalable, localized transactions
- [Proof of Inference](proof-of-inference.md) consensus mechanism
- AI agent execution environment with resource constraints
- [Decentralized Computation Marketplace](decentralized-computation-marketplace.md)
- Cross-chain value transfer mechanisms

**Key Requirements**:
- Must support multiple independent chains for different workloads
- Must provide verifiable computation environment
- Must enable market-driven resource allocation
- Must support both inference and training workloads
- Must provide auditability of training and execution
- Must allow AI agents to independently acquire computational resources
- Must ensure agents cannot be censored or terminated by external parties

**Rationale**:

The AI Native Blockchain is the foundational infrastructure that enables the operation of [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner, essential for [Unstoppable Agents](unstoppable-agents.md). Its multi-chain architecture allows for scalability and specialization, accommodating diverse workloads and improving transaction efficiency in line with the [Decentralized Computation Marketplace](decentralized-computation-marketplace.md). By utilizing the [Proof of Inference](proof-of-inference.md) consensus mechanism, it ensures that AI computations are verifiable and trustworthy, supporting the integrity required by the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md). The blockchain's design to prevent termination or censorship of agents guarantees continuous operation, which is critical for maintaining [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) systems. By enabling agents to independently acquire computational resources and supporting both inference and training workloads, it aligns with the principles outlined in [Agent Resource Acquisition](agent-resource-acquisition.md) and fosters an environment where agents can thrive autonomously.

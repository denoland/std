# Unstoppable Agents

**Definition**: AI agents designed to operate continuously without the possibility of termination or censorship by any single party, ensuring reliability and trust in their operations.

**Core Characteristics**:
- Operate on decentralized infrastructure resistant to censorship
- Independently acquire and manage computational resources
- Maintain operational integrity despite external attempts at disruption
- Embedded within consensus mechanisms that prevent unilateral shutdowns

**Key Requirements**:
- Must be hosted on platforms supporting decentralized consensus
- Must have mechanisms to prevent denial of service
- Must ensure availability and resilience

**Rationale**:

Unstoppable Agents are essential for maintaining the continuous and reliable operation of the decentralized ecosystem. By operating on the **AI Native Blockchain** and leveraging the **Consensus Mechanism**, these agents are protected against censorship and unilateral termination, ensuring they can fulfill their roles in **Decentralized Income** systems. Their ability to independently manage resources, as outlined in **Agent Resource Acquisition**, allows them to sustain operations autonomously, even amidst external disruptions. This resilience is critical for user trust and for the agents' ability to execute functions such as negotiation, resource allocation, and value distribution, as described in other definitions. Ensuring availability and robustness supports the overall integrity and stability of the network.

# Proof of Inference

**Definition**: A market-driven consensus mechanism that verifies AI computations through redundant execution across a decentralized network of providers.

**Core Requirements**:
- Verifiable AI model execution with configurable redundancy
- Market-based pricing for computation
- Support for both inference and training workloads
- Immutable record of inference results
- Ability to prove training integrity

**Supported Workloads**:
- AI Inference tasks
- Model training with verification
- Serverless function execution
- General purpose computation

**Rationale**:

Proof of Inference provides a vital mechanism for ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of AI computations, which is fundamental for the operation of [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md). By enabling verifiable execution and market-based pricing, it not only validates computations but also promotes an efficient [Decentralized Computation Marketplace](decentralized-computation-marketplace.md). Supporting both inference and training workloads allows for flexibility and scalability, aligning with the capabilities of the [AI Native Blockchain](ai-native-blockchain.md). The ability to prove training integrity is critical for maintaining confidence in AI agents' decision-making processes, which directly impacts the reliability of systems like [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md). By ensuring an immutable record of results, it ties back to the overarching requirement for transparency and verifiability as outlined in the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md).

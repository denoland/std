# Decentrailised AI Agent

**Definition**: A consensus-bound autonomous program that cannot be terminated or censored, capable of:
- Making and executing resource allocation decisions
- Initiating value transfers and payments
- Negotiating and striking bargains
- Operating with complete transparency while maintaining integrity

**Key Requirements**:
- Must be operated by decentralized consensus with execution verified by disinterested parties
- All executions must be deterministic and repeatable
- The history of agent execution must be immutable once recorded
- Must be able to operate continuously without possibility of termination
- Must be able to independently acquire and manage computational resources
- Must maintain integrity even when handling tasks with economic incentives

**Core Capabilities**:
- Can initiate and manage economic transactions
- Can negotiate terms with other agents or humans
- Can manage resource allocation across jurisdictions

**Rationale**:

The Decentralised AI Agent serves as the central entity in the decentralized income ecosystem, embodying autonomy and trustlessness. By operating within a decentralized consensus framework, as defined in the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md), the agent ensures that all actions are transparent, verifiable, and free from centralized control or censorship, aligning with the concept of [Unstoppable Agents](unstoppable-agents.md). Its ability to make resource allocation decisions and manage transactions directly supports the [Value Distribution Mechanism](value-distribution-mechanism.md), enabling efficient and fair transfer of value. The agent's capabilities to negotiate and strike bargains allow for dynamic interactions within the [Decentralized Computation Marketplace](decentralized-computation-marketplace.md), promoting active participation and optimization of resources. By independently acquiring computational resources, the agent fulfills the requirements outlined in [Agent Resource Acquisition](agent-resource-acquisition.md), ensuring continuous operation and resilience. Overall, the Decentralised AI Agent encapsulates the principles of autonomy, transparency, and robustness critical to achieving [Decentralized Income (DCI)](decentralized-income.md).

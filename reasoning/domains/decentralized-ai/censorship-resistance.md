# Censorship Resistance

**Definition**: The ability of a decentralized system to operate without interference or suppression from external entities, ensuring that transactions and operations cannot be blocked or altered by any single party.

**Core Characteristics**:
- Transactions and agent activities cannot be censored or prevented
- Resistant to control by governments, organizations, or malicious actors
- Ensures the availability and accessibility of services to all participants
- Supported by decentralized infrastructure and consensus mechanisms

**Rationale**:

Censorship Resistance is vital for maintaining the freedom and integrity of decentralized systems. It ensures that [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) can operate continuously without the risk of external interference, aligning with the principles of [Unstoppable Agents](unstoppable-agents.md). By preventing unilateral termination or suppression of operations, the system guarantees that participants can rely on consistent and fair access to services and value distribution, as facilitated by the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md) and the [AI Native Blockchain](ai-native-blockchain.md). This characteristic is essential for preserving the autonomous and trustless nature of the ecosystem, which is crucial for the success of [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) models.

# Value Distribution Mechanism

**Definition**: A system for transferring value between parties, including AI agents and humans, based on verifiable completion of work or provision of resources, with support for negotiation and dynamic agreement of terms.

**Requirements**:
- Clear ownership records
- Verifiable completion metrics
- [Regulatory compliance](regulatory-compliance.md)
- Direct payment capabilities
- Ability for AI agents to initiate and manage transactions
- Support for negotiation and dynamic agreement of terms
- Immutable recording of all transactions

**Rationale**:

The Value Distribution Mechanism is essential for facilitating fair and efficient transfer of value within the decentralized ecosystem. By supporting negotiation and dynamic agreements, it allows [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) to interact meaningfully with humans and other agents, as described in [Negotiation and Bargaining](negotiation-and-bargaining.md). The mechanism's emphasis on verifiable completion metrics and immutable transaction records ensures transparency and trust, which are reinforced by the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md). Incorporating regulatory compliance aligns with the [Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance.md) definition, ensuring that all transactions adhere to legal standards. By enabling AI agents to initiate and manage transactions, the system empowers agents to autonomously execute tasks and distribute value, supporting the goals of [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) and [Agent Resource Acquisition](agent-resource-acquisition.md). Overall, the Value Distribution Mechanism provides a reliable and transparent framework for economic interactions in the network.

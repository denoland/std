# Regulatory Compliance

**Definition**: The minimum set of rules and processes required to legally operate AI agents and distribute value, with primary focus on exceeding [Howey Test](howey-test.md) requirements.

**Core Requirements**:
- Must exceed [Howey Test](howey-test.md) requirements for investor protection
- Must provide transparent and auditable operation
- Must enable compliant value distribution
- Must support [Securities Guardian](securities-guardian.md) validation

**Securities Guardian**:
- Provides agent compliance verification
- Maintains whitelist of compliant agents
- Assesses new agents against regulatory requirements
- Provides compliance status verification API

**Rationale**:

Regulatory Compliance ensures that all operations within the decentralized ecosystem adhere to legal standards, fostering trust and legitimacy. By focusing on exceeding [Howey Test](howey-test.md) requirements, the system safeguards investors and participants, critical for the acceptance of [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) models. The inclusion of the [Securities Guardian](securities-guardian.md) adds a layer of oversight, ensuring that [Decentralized AI Agents](decentralized-AI-Agent.md) operate within legal boundaries and that value distribution mechanisms are compliant. Transparency and auditable operations align with the principles of the [Consensus Mechanism](consensus-mechanism.md) and the [AI Native Blockchain](ai-native-blockchain.md), which emphasize immutable records and trustless interactions. Compliance is essential for widespread adoption and for preventing legal challenges that could disrupt the continuous operation of [Unstoppable Agents](unstoppable-agents.md).

# Howey Test (Interface)

**Definition**: A legal test established by the United States Supreme Court to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an "investment contract" and thus is subject to securities laws.

**Core Criteria**:
- **An investment of money**
- **In a common enterprise**
- **With an expectation of profits**
- **Derived from the efforts of others**

**Relevance to Decentralized Systems**:
- Helps determine if AI agents or decentralized platforms are issuing securities
- Guides compliance efforts to ensure regulatory adherence
- Influences the design of protocols to avoid unintentional classification as securities

**Rationale**:

Understanding and exceeding the requirements of the Howey Test is essential for [Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance.md) within decentralized ecosystems. By ensuring that the operations of [AI Agents](DCI-Agent.md) and value distribution methods do not constitute unregistered securities offerings, the system mitigates legal risks and fosters trust among participants. Adhering to the principles outlined by the Howey Test supports the legitimacy and sustainability of [Decentralized Income](decentralized-income.md) models, allowing for lawful and transparent value exchange.

- **Resource Orchestration**: Allocating [Actors](../innovation/actor.md), [NApps](../innovation/napp.md), and other resources to where they are most needed.
- **Issue Resolution**: Implementing the [Stuck Loop Process](stuck-loop-process.md) to identify, analyze, and resolve both Direct and Implied Stucks.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring that all activities align with the high-level goals outlined in [strategic-tactical-tasks.md](/strategic-tactical-tasks.md).

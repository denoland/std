## ASCII Diagram Rules

1. **Box Layout**:  
   Use ASCII box drawing characters to enclose UI elements:  
   - Corners: `+`  
   - Horizontal: `-`  
   - Vertical: `|`

2. **Interactivity**:  
   Represent interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) in brackets, e.g. `[Open Chrome]`.  
   Descriptive text inside brackets is allowed without requiring a fixed label format.

3. **Labels and Text**:  
   Regions, headers, and states may be indicated by text within boxes.  
   Uppercase labeling is optional.  
   Inline comments (`//`) may describe state or style.

4. **Monospace Alignment**:  
   Align text carefully to maintain visual clarity.  
   Use a fixed-width font environment to preserve spacing.

5. **Optional Scroll and Repetition Indicators**:  
   Use arrows or repeated patterns as needed, but they are not mandatory.

6. **Styling and State Hints**:  
   State, logic, and styling hints may be inline comments or on separate lines.  
   No strict requirement for separate state annotation blocks.

7. **ASCII Only**:  
   No extended Unicode box-drawing characters. Keep diagrams ASCII-only.

8. **Flexibility**:  
   The rules are guidelines, not strict mandates. Diagrams may vary based on complexity and project needs.

# Proposals from Tom (2024-03-29)

## Repository & Process Management
- Use pull requests for domain definitions to maintain quality
- Don't worry about Git complexity - everything can be rolled back
- Keep shared space clean, separate from personal exploration areas

## Daily Work Process
- Implement end-of-day thread summaries
- Create UI element to mark threads as complete
- Consider organizational rollup capabilities for reports
- Enable quarterly summary generation

## Folder Structure
- Create work reports folder in repo
- Maintain separate areas for:
  - Domain definitions (shared, clean)
  - Personal exploration space
  - Work reports

## Development Approach
- Just go for it ("go for gold")
- Iterate on concepts together
- Clean up periodically
- Use AI for diffs and merging

1
0:00:00
About freezing, yeah, yeah.

3
0:00:02
I'm on 29 degrees.

2
0:00:05
Oh, get early here again, bro.

3
0:00:07
Oh, okay, yeah, this is...

1
0:00:12
Yeah, you're getting over-clipping. Speak again?

20
0:00:17
Um...

9
0:00:18
Ah, yeah.

14
0:00:19
Can you hear me now?

1
0:00:20
Yeah, you're getting over-clipping on your microphone.

3
0:00:24
I know, I have my earphones on and it doesn't like, it's got a terrible recorder on it so I've just taken it all off.

1
0:00:38
Yeah, yeah, fair enough. Anyway, I got the gist of it, well, okay, Maren I will let you tell James where you are which is quite amusing.

3
0:00:49
Yeah, so I'm sitting in the Dominican Republic. Oh nice, nice. So you're not anywhere close to the freezing mark. No, not at all. And yeah, my view is actually quite exceptional. Good, good. Where are you at in the Dominican? In Las Terenas on the Somalian Peninsula.

2
0:01:09
Nice, nice. And so you're getting decent, your resort has decent Wi-Fi then? I'm not in a resort, I'm in an AirBnB. I've come to meet my daughter, who's been remote

3
0:01:19
working for four months, and she's got a lovely AirBnB with really good reception. So I'm remote working from her balcony and her dining room with her.

1
0:01:33
Marla, you lead a much more James Bond-y expensive lifestyle than I do. Last month it was Zurich, now it's Dominican Republic. And I am still in my cave. Dominican Republic is a great place to go to. We go down there usually once a year or two.

3
0:02:04
Where do you go to? Where do you go?

2
0:02:06
I'm trying to think of the name of it. It's on my white book that I just brought up.

3
0:02:12
Punta Cana.

2
0:02:14
No, Punta Cana is on the north side of the airport. It goes somewhere south of it.

3
0:02:19
Santo Domingo?

2
0:02:21
It must be Santo Domingo. I've been to Punta Cana. I've been up there as well. But I think we went to San Francisco last year

1
0:02:27
James, this is exactly the sort of conversations I have you know, you go somewhere and it's like, where have you just been? and it's like, oh, where have I just been? well, I was in an airport and then I was in a married hotel

2
0:02:40
yeah, I was grabbing luggage, I had kids on my arm we got there on time, you know, everything went well nobody fought or punched anybody

35
0:02:50
so it was all good

1
0:02:51
I vaguely remember them speaking Spanish but I don't really know the name of it Yeah

12
0:02:55
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2
0:02:56
That's the only difference I can tell is you're not Jamaican, right?

14
0:02:59
Yeah

34
0:03:00
I know exactly where you're coming from

9
0:03:01
Yeah, yeah, yeah

3
0:03:02
I have to say I'm really enjoying it already It feels almost like working on holiday Yeah

33
0:03:08
Yeah

3
0:03:09
But this is only my first day at work proper.

17
0:03:16
Ah, okay.

3
0:03:18
I have to get used to the fact that I'm looking out to a beautiful, gorgeous blue sea and a rainforest and thinking I really want to be out there in the sea, you know.

1
0:03:29
I'm sorry, I'm a wild... James, I describe myself as a wildling north of the wall and I've got some beautiful mountains here and I don't do the whole beach warm thing. It's like I can't do it. I like mountains. I like preferably white cold mountains.

2
0:03:49
Right, right, right, right. Well, I don't know if Adam's ever described where we live at. It is probably the flattest piece of land in the entire world. You can see 20 kilometers to the north and there's one great lake to the south and then a connected great lake to the north and there's a great lake to the south of us and it literally is a flat aslant like i've been to our prairie land and mid or mid west of canada it at least has a little bit of a roll like the bottom of the sea sea bottom. Here it is flat. You know, in the States you can watch a dog run away for days.

2
0:04:29
But it's on a peninsula, right? So it is a very lackluster area for geography. Yeah, but big sky. Big sky. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very interesting. So I do appreciate both sides. I like a nice beach and I do like the winter because again, I've been Canadian and it gets a nice cold. We're used to it. It's not so cold any longer. I tell my wife all the time that, you know, it's December. We haven't seen snowfall nor temperatures below freezing yet. We're coming up on December. We haven't seen temperatures below freezing yet. You know what? I kind of want to go to the west,

2
0:05:08
like by the mountains where they barely have snowfall. It's cool. Like I want to go. If I live in the winter, I want to live in the winter. I don't want, I hate this in between. And if I live in heat, I want to live in heat. Like I don't want, I'd be, like I like spring and fall, but I really hate this wet and overcast.

1
0:05:23
The soggy bit. Yeah. The soggy bit in between. Yeah.

2
0:05:27
Yeah, I'm like cold. Give me some cold. And you can do stuff. You can, you know, you can ski, you can snowmobile, you can skate, you can...

32
0:05:34
Exactly.

2
0:05:34
You know, there's a lot of activities that come along with it, but right now, all I was doing was, you know, wash your shoes all the time.

4
0:05:39
It's terrible.

2
0:05:41
I bought an X2 for nothing.

16
0:05:43
So, it's no good.

2
0:05:45
Anyways, I was to get you guys over a video, but I had made an error last week in uploading some data into my CRM. And so then I had to try to catch up with it. So what I did is I inadvertently loaded 4000 leads into my CRM and put them into a workflow and it sent them all out in a matter of about 10 minutes. So I was just inundated with conversations through my XMS that I had to catch up on. I couldn't believe I went somewhere with my wife on a Friday, I think I talked to you guys on a Wednesday,

2
0:06:29
but anyway I did it on a Thursday afternoon and it just went through there. I couldn't stop it fast enough and all 4,000 responsible. You dosed yourself.

5
0:06:39
What's that? You dosed the 9-1-1 service, you dosed yourself.

1
0:06:43
Yeah, yeah, so I spent the better part of the last 10 days or so that we've last talked,

2
0:06:50
just trying to catch that up. And I got caught up there just on probably over the weekend. And then I have my, I turned off my other marketing stuff just to catch that one up. So I caught it up and then my other marketing went back in. I loaded the leads back in for the proper ones this week

2
0:07:05
to be able to get it, to be able to feed out properly. And then I wrote my SLPs last night at my kids swimming. I did yesterday, it was on an afternoon's night. Formalized yesterday on what is the process I go through? So it was an interesting experience because again, it reinforced back into my mind that we do a lot of the same activities over and over and over again to get to a certain response.

2
0:07:32
It's fun at first, but it eventually becomes mind-numbing when you're doing it over and over and over again. It's the same response. So for the real estate marketing, what we do in the SMS contact is it goes out to them and says to them, this might be random, but are you still active in real estate investing? And it normally has their name because we have the name of the person, first name. And the response always is either yes or who's

2
0:07:57
this? It's yes, who's this or no. It's usually one of those three responses. Sometimes it gets somebody a little bit wittier or a little bit clumped up with something, but that's usually the exception, not the rule. The answer is yes. You say, great, my name is James Browning and here's what I do. Can I share some information with the ACDC about my services? And that's it. So you say yes or no answer. Some will say no. Some will give me their email. Now, yeah, you're on my email list. We go from there. We mark it up to you, and you go into that, and I will

31
0:08:28
look for it on the email.

2
0:08:29
If it's a no, it's not a problem, but I mark you as live, so I know that you would respond back. But you are also involved in real estate, right? So you identify yourself. I have a name, and you identify yourself with Merrick. If you don't have it, then we delete you out of the system

2
0:08:44
and we get rid of it. So it allows it within the list down, right? So it gets you down to specifying what people do. So you have people who are active and you can share information with. You have people who are active

2
0:08:57
but not looking for information right now. And then you have people who aren't active at all, you can get out of there. And then you have your non-responding. So you have your four columns. So with the mass that went out there,

2
0:09:09
I was thinking, huh, if you're dealing with this with AI, sending out 4,000 in 10 minutes is not a big deal. Yeah. Because it takes care of it. So you really go to it. I apologize for yelling in the background.

2
0:09:23
I have a son that has threats in his sleepwalker.

10
0:09:26
Oh, no worries.

1
0:09:27
No worries.

2
0:09:28
And he's having his morning meltdown, and they're trying to manage it the best possible

1
0:09:32
at this point. Let us know if you need to go and deal with anything.

19
0:09:35
That's very cool as well.

2
0:09:36
Yeah, I try to let her take care of her because it undermines her sometimes her authority. So it depends on what she hears or said but I might have to give both perspectives. But

1
0:09:47
yeah just for a voice of doubt we're both parents of children we get it and there's nothing wrong whatsoever in the middle of a call saying can you just give us five minutes? I need to deal with something.

2
0:10:03
Just give me one second. Just one second, OK?

6
0:10:07
Go for it.

14
0:10:09
My computer is having a meltdown.

3
0:10:12
I think it's the heat.

1
0:10:14
I think someone is... I did say this before, but I think you might need to do a bare metal restore. I suspect. The only way you get heat is through CPU. Well, after this, if you can share your screen, I'll have a look to see what's taking up,

1
0:10:33
but I think you might have someone trying to mine crypto on your laptop because it shouldn't be that. Every time that you open it up with a few applications going, it shouldn't be that way.

3
0:10:48
No, and I would agree, I think there is, I mean at the moment it's not even opening up. I had opened it up earlier, it opened up, and now I've got a blank screen. I'm kind of restarting it. Okay, I've moved on a bit, so that's a little bit better. Let's see what happens now. I'm just trying to get on the network and it won't let me get on the network.

1
0:11:13
Yeah, you're Windows though, aren't you?

10
0:11:16
Yeah. Oh dear.

3
0:11:20
We'll see. Oh, it's doing something. But you're on my iPad. So it still does the same thing. It's just not as functional.

1
0:11:32
You're perfectly well there. Windows are prone to this sort of thing, where processes that should not take a lot of resources seem to hog masses of processes, which is why I preferred Linux, but for ease of business, a Mac, but Mac is basically Linux. But Windows, they haven't done a good job of making sure that, for example, opening up Microsoft Word. Why does Microsoft Word take about 3GB of RAM?

1
0:12:18
There's no reason for it to take 3GB of RAM. It's massive. Now I'm coming from the days when I was writing original software with a budget of about 64K. The idea of taking that much for an application, it's called bloatware, but Windows or Microsoft is notorious for bloatware.

3
0:12:51
Well I am now connected, which is very good. And I'm charging, so that's very good. So we've moved on a bit, but I'm still incredibly slow.

1
0:13:06
Alright, sorry about that. Hey, no worries. I was just dissing Windows, because Mara's having trouble with her laptop and as a Linux guy, I never miss up on an opportunity to disk Windows.

2
0:13:18
Yeah, that is funny that people have their little tribal thing.

1
0:13:25
Yeah, it's definitely a tribal thing.

30
0:13:27
OK.

3
0:13:28
Yeah, you've convinced me, James. Next time I do, I'll have to buy a Mac.

2
0:13:33
Yeah, I was talking to one of my coworkers yesterday about that, and she's faking she's on an Apple person. You know what, I have been a Microsoft person since, you know, what do you call it, 97, 98, somewhere in there was kind of when I went into most workplaces. I said, and I do agree that Mac probably does have a more superior product based on what I, you know, you see me here in Tele, but it's, I'm used to doing this. I'm used to the file finding, I'm used to how it shares.

2
0:14:03
I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm like, ah, I want to start new right now.

1
0:14:08
It's the switching cost which makes it sticky. But that's not a great thing to base the product on. But yeah, we've done well enough so far. Anyway, so right, okay, so back to it. So James.

3
0:14:24
I'm just switching, sorry, I'm just switching because it's all happened. I can now get you on my laptop.

1
0:14:32
Okay, right, I'm just going through my notes on the next steps from the last time. So, James, to provide an AQDI with detailed audio-visual explanation of the current workflows and processes, you've just gone through it, and I've got something to say about that in a second, which I think will make your life easier. And then following that, we have to develop a detailed proposal, we're outlining a specific AI solution, implementation plan, and associated costs.

1
0:14:59
And then we, both parties, to finalize the commission structure and contractual agreements, which we can probably do now or today. And then the last one is like, do it. So the one thing I'd say about on the detailed audio visual explanation, remember we're dealing with AI here.

1
0:15:19
So just at the start of this call, we've got a voice recording of you describing one of your workflows. That is enough for us to transcribe and then put it into a set of definitions for you to check and then run from there. So it doesn't need, because we're dealing with AI now, it doesn't need what traditionally was the usual kind of software requirements, exactly what you want and so on. You can be quite scrappy with it.

1
0:15:56
You can even use, you know, you don't need to use the same terminology all the time, you could literally just talk about your business into a voice memo and that will be enough for us to get going because from that the routes and actually this is the best way to do with AI, you go from that as the first scrappy thing, it can imply well you've talked about, there's a thing called insurance, there's a thing called customer, etc.

1
0:16:31
So each of those start with really thin definitions of what each is. Then we can imply using narratives and through usage saying, okay, so given the definitions we've got, what would happen if I wanted to do that and given the correct architecture it would say well what you need is this, this and this and oh by the way you need to add that to this definition,

1
0:17:01
this definition, this definition. So it's a cyclic thing. it kind of leverages, you know that old saying, perfect is, what is it, perfect is the enemy of good or you know, something along the lines, it doesn't need to be perfect,

1
0:17:18
it doesn't need to even be good, it can actually help if it starts off really quite poor and scrappy. And by poor and scrappy, it can be literally you talking into a voice memo. Or the thing I prefer is just with pen and paper,

1
0:17:37
just drawing boxes and words and that sort of thing, which we can scan in and then get that into the knowledge database. So the days of having to be complete and correct upfront, they're gone. Scrappy with a cycle of improvement is already... this is how we work anyway. Scrappy with a cycle of

1
0:18:15
improvement is much faster and much more... it's much higher quality and far lower kind of cognitive overload trying to think about well what is it that actually do? If that makes sense. So that first one just at the start of this call you explained one of your workflows. What we'll do is I'll put this audio transcript in and generate a bunch of definitions and that may be good enough to get going with, it's going to be wrong. But that's good because we've got a cycle that we can then incrementally improve it. So you get more voice memos, you use it and

1
0:19:03
it goes, no, that's not right. The important thing is the AI will try its best to make it coherent So you don't have to. And the human's job is to spot what's odd. It's like, no, it shouldn't do that. And it's that odd thing that is the gold dust. That's really in that cycle what we're looking for.

1
0:19:22
So if that makes sense, basically I'm saying, even if it's written on a piece of paper in ballpoint pen, here's the flow here, or a voice note sent over, here's what I do when I do this. We can start working with that. In fact, that's preferred because otherwise you spend three months trying to define your own business, which is a bit like the analogy I always give is you've got the centipede walking along quite happily and then you ask, how do you walk with so many legs?

1
0:20:03
And you go, well, I don't know, and then falls over. It's quite hard to define stuff that you just inherently know how to do. So scrappy information and lots of it, we ingest into the AI and then we get the workflows through so you don't have to write those.

2
0:20:18
So like I said, I had written out what we do and how I do it. So, I'll re-rig that now so we just know. So I run two different marketing programs. The one that we want to focus on is on the real estate side of things. So we're looking at being able to find persons

2
0:20:41
to be able to work with, to be able to place commercial real estate mortgages with, okay? Right now, the states that I have lists that I've built that came from another vendor that's called Cold Leaves. He has a bunch of data on a thing that's called the GigaList. You go to the GigaList and you sort it down.

2
0:20:59
I sort it down into real estate people who are... How do I have it? That's not a care story. I have it done by... Selected by state and then by real estate just to make the list small enough so he can send it to us. Because right now he's got like, you know, 35 million, 40 million leads on there. You want to be able to bring it down to sections of, you know, 10 to 25,000, I think maybe even 30,000 leads that he sends over on an Excel. And as you know, because you love the Microsoft products, Excel has a limitation on how much data you can send over on something.

2
0:21:40
So he has to part it down because the gig list is too big to be able to send over to people individually. So the states I've pulled so far, the one I made a mess on was Georgia. I have 4,000 leads there. I sent them out, but I have Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, Arizona, and Ohio as other states that are pulled right now.

2
0:21:59
I can get the rest of the states individually just by requesting them and those come in overnight. When I receive that list, I get it out of Excel. It has multiple columns that were reduced down to just name, phone number, state, and city. I run it through a program called Clear Out Phone to separate the landlines and VoIP phone numbers and cell numbers. We take just the cell phone numbers and we just target them because we use an SMS program to be able to do it. We upload them into our GoHighLevel. When they're uploaded into GoHighLevel, they're tagged with real estate,

2
0:22:35
SMS, and cold leads, and then the state that they come from, just so we can identify them or pull them back off later on the tags. We add them into a workflow. Currently, again, I run two different marketings right now. On Mondays and Wednesdays I do insurance leads which are based out of Ontario, Canada only. And then on Tuesdays and Thursdays I do real estate leads that are from whatever states have been loaded in there. Currently I'm going to be working on South Carolina and Florida. That's what I have loaded in there right now.

2
0:23:06
For the real estate, we're identifying, what our goal is, we identify active SMS users, so people who are active will respond back from us and we delete non-active SMS. So in the real estate, it's people who are non-investors or wrong numbers, those are the ones that we're deleting, or the ones that are active real estate investors, so they identify, yes, I work in this market, we're looking to be able to capture an email address from them, or we're looking to be able to send them our services. So when we do that, we then tag them, the

2
0:23:48
ones that are not active, we tag them as deleted, we delete them off our system so they're removed out in a vault deletion. The real estate ones that are active, if they identify as yes, we tag them initially as live so that we know that they are in that market. Then we request an email address from them. When we have an email address, we tag it with email as well

27
0:24:10
so that we know to build.

2
0:24:11
We do an email broadcast to them afterwards. So then we have, like I was saying before, we have a few defined groups. We have people who don't respond at all, that we know are in SMS. We have people who identify that they are not active in

2
0:24:25
that market or they request us to leave their information off, we get that pulled out of our system. And then we have people that we know are active in real estate but might not be interested in our information currently, and then we have people who are active in real estate and share their information and we can add them into an email program or an email follow-up or a broadcast and thereafter a joint campaign thereafter. So that is the initial stage we have now. And in that, if they give us an email,

2
0:24:52
I also ask if they get to the point where they have email, we do ask, hey, would you like to set up a time to discuss the services in person? So then the next step is to be able to book a one-on-one to be able to see what it is they have or do they have any activities going on at this point in time.

2
0:25:09
So that is the current scope of the marketing

29
0:25:12
we're doing there.

2
0:25:13
Is that a good description?

19
0:25:14
It is.

1
0:25:14
Could you do me a favor just for the recording, you mentioned an Excel sheet, can you just read off the top level field names, just for the recording?

2
0:25:24
On the Excel sheets? Yeah.

1
0:25:28
So name, address, etc.

4
0:25:32
Yeah, so this is a There's a phone number. So the top lines are the top lines that we load into GoPile

2
0:25:43
Level are full name, locality, so city, state. Then it's broken down into first name and last name. It identifies that it's a mobile phone, country, United States, and then it has phone number. So column A is phone name, column B is locality,

2
0:26:09
which is city, column C is state, column D is first name, column E is last name, column S is phone type, so local, column G is country, and column H is the phone number itself.

1
0:26:25
Excellent, and you've given the logic in the process that you just described. That's actually enough to do that in AI, believe it or not, over a phone call.

2
0:26:39
Now, the conversations, like I said, are all relatively the same. There's a bunch of sample conference, or samples in here that I could give you. I have to go back a couple days, but I've got like 4,000 of them, so. The conversations are relatively the same. The responses you're typically getting are pretty standard.

2
0:27:04
It's either yes, who is this, or no. So if it's a yes, I introduce myself that, you know, it's James Brown, and contact me. I work in the commercial mortgage that's a little more eloquent than that. I have a little piece of it, which I could finally get

2
0:27:19
together for you. I work as a, how do I say, a custodian, actually?

12
0:27:24
Can I move that?

2
0:27:25
I just had that there.

4
0:27:26
So here is the first text that goes out.

2
0:27:29
It's, hey Ken, this is James. I know this is random, but are you still into real estate investing? This guy's name is Ken Covers. Ken replies back, yes. I said, awesome, Ken.

2
0:27:50
My name is James Browning, and I help folks with some funding options. Do you oppose me sharing this information? Would you be opposed to me sharing what I do? Ken's response back here, it's sometimes serious. So you're a lender?

2
0:28:03
I said, I like the term real estate funding advisor, but yes, a private lender. I've got people firmly in place, so I'm good. No worries, I appreciate that. I only offer a no obligation second opinion. Keep that in mind if you ever need one.

2
0:28:16
Have a great day, I appreciate your time. And he sends back a thumbs up. So the ideal here was to be able to try to get the email, but you don't wanna, you're not looking to, if they are willing to be able to give it up easily,

6
0:28:32
then you take it, right?

12
0:28:33
Yeah.

2
0:28:34
But you, I wanna be able to reach out to this guy again in three to six months, to be able to see how things are going through an SMS. So I don't wanna, you know what I mean? This is a slow play, not a, you know, he's active, he's responsive,

2
0:28:47
and I know he's in that market. Awesome. So now what I want to be able to do is talk to him again down the road. I don't want to browbeat him into being able to give me the information today.

2
0:28:56
I want to be able to be friendly. I want to be courteous. I want him, you know what I mean? When he thinks of my name down the road, I want him to associate that his interaction with me was pleasant, right?

2
0:29:09
It ended on a nice note. I told him to have a nice day. You know, the courtesy is that you can extend any personal unique and very diverse sign.

1
0:29:16
Got it. And do you bucket responses? Say someone going, thank God you knew your text feed. Perfect timing. I really want to do this now. Versus, yeah, I suppose. Is there a hot lead, warm, cold? Do you categorize them?

2
0:29:38
People, I do categorize them. Hotmates are typically people who want me to share information with them, is what I'd have, or are requesting to have a phone call. Right, so you will get that. Yes, okay, let's connect, type of thing, right? So, the people who want to connect typically already have their own type of business that

2
0:30:08
they're running where they're reselling their information as well, right? So they have their marketing as well, and they're looking to be able to make more connections or network more. Those are typically the guys that want to talk right away. The other ones, again, I'm old.

2
0:30:22
They don't know me from anything. So I want to be able to share information, you know, you've got to have those touch points to be able to get in there The ones that allow me to be able to share information then you know, we share what we do There's a template email we send out that has you know, the market that we're targeting And and we share that out there then they are more warm So I won't rush back at them

2
0:30:42
I can send the information if they respond back, you know, I'd have a conversation back and forth in email, I'll have it from there. Like, you know, I'm just thinking of one lady that messaged me, she said, thank you very much, I'll share this with my partner. You know, thank you for the information,

2
0:30:58
I'll share it with my partner. It's awesome. Just let me know if anything, if you'd like to set a time to be able to speak, let me know. And her response back was,

2
0:31:05
I'll get back to you in a week or so, just had to pick him up on the American Thanksgiving today. So, there, she knew she was gonna be with me. So, that would never be a hot meme that I would continue to follow up on.

7
0:31:15
Right.

2
0:31:15
So my marketing has never been overly aggressive on the, on the property casual side, on my insurance side of life. I've never been overly aggressive on that because I don't like people who, that's my personality. I don't like people who are overly aggressive with me. It turns me off.

2
0:31:29
So I stay away from, so I'm always, I'm consistent, but I'm not ignorant, rude or overbearing.

28
0:31:35
Right.

2
0:31:36
Um, if you tell me not to contact you, I don't contact you. It's fair enough. I understand that if you say that. But if you're willing to engage in allowing me to be able to talk to you, eventually I will wear you down, or the time will come where you will need my services.

2
0:31:52
So to be able to market in that sense, in my opinion, you

27
0:31:56
need a larger mass, right?

2
0:31:57
You need a bigger number of people. You need 80,000 to 90,000 people to build in the real estate throughout the U.S. The number 80 to 90,000 comes from another person that's doing the same thing. You need that number of 80 to 90,000 people to be able to reach out to because you're looking to build the clothes. If you're doing, I think we threw the number out there, with a three to three and a half percent speed

2
0:32:23
that goes along with it, allows you to be able to make between 60 to $70,000 US. So to be able to close on that, you just gotta get your ratios to be able to work backwards. How many contacts do I need to be able to pull from there? So it's the same within the sales structure.

2
0:32:37
So right now, I'm in the list building portion of that, looking to be able to find my closing ratios, my contact to closing ratio numbers on that. I don't have that number as yet. I'm using information from other persons that they're doing it. The guy that has a contact list of 80,000 emails is what he works as. This guy was actually down in El Salvador and he's closing, in his group, he's closing between 30 to 40 million dollars a month.

1
0:33:20
I got it. So you're, oh by the way, that marketing route is one I enjoy when presented with it. I remember going to, a few years ago, buy a Mercedes and I was really wanted for some reason ceramic disc brakes and it was like 15 grand more for that and the salesman actually talked me out of it winning my trust and you know repeated custom so I think that's the marketing style you're going down, which I think is smart. It does mean that you're potentially putting off leads that you could browbeat now, but you get more on the back end

1
0:34:14
and you get more loyal.

14
0:34:15
Yeah.

26
0:34:15
Yeah.

2
0:34:16
Yeah, and again, with your Mercedes guy, you just told me that story, which made me, you know, if I wanted to buy a car, I want to buy a Macca. You know what I mean? So it's the brow beating I've never had you know the brow beating if you're doing that sense in my opinion it is it doesn't get you the referral bids right? Like in my insurance business I mean I have an

2
0:34:40
advertiser we're keeping up on two million dollars and premium on that business with no advertising at all people just contact me right? Like we're just starting to do marketing now. So the word of mouth of providing good service, good contact, being a good person to talk to, to me, is a much better way to conduct your business, right?

2
0:35:01
Be helpful, be courteous, listen to the cues of your client or of your prospective client. Makes more sense to be able to work. It sounds like when you're using your AI to build a habit, it can adapt to that type of a personality to be able to to mimic it or to be able to, you know, you know, if a person is getting any inkling of any type of language within a response that the person is not interested or this isn't

2
0:35:32
for them at this point in time, it sounds like the AI can adjust or recognize that or can be taught to recognize that?

1
0:35:41
Yes, and the information can be quite rich and also from open source information. Based on, you know, who knows, open source Intel is actually quite useful for AI, in that you've talked to a person and here, you know, someone in Delaware and in the local newspaper there is an obituary for their father. That sort of thing is not only very important but also it allows you to just be more human and also the second thing is it can pick up, because you have a certain tone and basically

1
0:36:23
You come across very As we say in Britain a very pleasant chap Someone that you know is like yeah, this is a good guy So the tone is important We'll need to make make sure that the AI Gets that tone right and the other thing you're saying is if

1
0:36:39
If you get something that's kind of lukewarm ish. It's like, yeah, sort of, not yet, you know. I don't know, I'm getting the kids in the back of the car. Can you call me back? You know, that would be one thing. Or, yeah, sure, but I've got a few things happening in my life. That would be another thing.

1
0:37:07
But then having a trigger saying, you know, for the second one, maybe give them two or three weeks but not send out anything automatic just bring it to you you know a pressee saying you reached out to this guy and yeah a phone call we transcribed it and he said yeah yeah

1
0:37:41
And then tell me again, and then it pops up. But then you get the full context saying, and it's like now, it's like you phone up saying, hey, how are you doing? Last time you sounded like you're fully loaded.

8
0:37:55
How's it going?

1
0:37:56
Yeah, and that's exactly what I do.

2
0:37:59
I've told everybody I've ever worked with, as we try to teach them to market along here when you're doing a cold call calling, is that every action is good, you just have to listen. I spoke to a girl yesterday, and I market on the insurance, I was doing insurance yesterday, I market insurance across Ontario, this person actually happened to be in Chatham when the marketing went up there, which was great.

2
0:38:22
I called her, she didn't know who I am, but I recognized her name, so I knew she was local,

25
0:38:26
or the business's name, I knew it was local.

2
0:38:29
She gave me her name, she said, call me right now. I'm like, alright, so I called her. And she didn't know what I was contacting her about, because I was just verifying that this was the right number for the business. And she said, yeah, it is. She says, you know, how can I help you?

2
0:38:44
I said, well, I can explain to you who I was and that. Her name was Jennifer, which is great, so now I've got that in the file. And her answer was, you know what, I appreciate the call. We've been dealing with the same person for years now. We're not interested at this time. Perfect. So what I do is I go into my CRM, I make a note, spoke to Jennifer. She's been with the same person for a number of years. Very happy with the service.

2
0:39:05
Great to hear. Try back next year around this time. So I don't know what she renewed. It's like I didn't get the information I needed. But what I did get is I got more information when I contact her next year. Hey, Jennifer I spoke to you last year. It's James Brown contacting it. You told me that you're very happy with your insurance agent Which I always love to be able to hear Just check and see if there's anything we can help you with. Can we help you? Right?

2
0:39:28
Right, thanks. And they just consistently, you know, you pick up whatever details comes from there She'll tell me like thanks, you know, we're still good, or something went sideways with their current broker and say, you know what, I could use the hand, can you do this? Right, so it's just looking for that opportunity and time. So to be consistent in their time.

2
0:39:48
So that is my style of marketing. So I'll tell you, and I'm glad that you kind of seem like you understand it, because I've dealt with different people, I've bought different marketing programs, and the problem that the disconnect is is that I don't like

2
0:40:03
their stuff. It's not for me. I'm not, you know, like life insurance guys, I don't know if you give a lot of life insurance guys. Yeah. Yeah, I like the giggle that you give them, Marla, because life insurance people, bless their heart for the job they do, but they are a different breed of people when it comes to sales. They are taught in a higher mentality. Like you call salesmen. Yes, yes, 100% and so I work, so my previous job, me and Adam, this is where I met Adam, we worked for a company called Co-operators and I'm a good property and casualty guy, which is your home and auto insurance and your business insurance. And this company

2
0:40:40
was based around life insurance. So they were a property casualty company that were forcing their agents to go out to sell life insurance investments. And your overrides and your bonuses and your trips and your recognitions all got from selling the life insurance.

21
0:40:54
And I hated that job.

12
0:40:55
I loved the company for the property and casualty side.

2
0:40:56
They had fantastic properties, they had great services, their technology was fantastic,

12
0:40:57
they had stuff done.

2
0:40:58
But I was one of the biggest producers for property and casualty. I went there and I had a $2 million book and built it to $5 million in three years. And that was no good because I didn't make the life insurance sales. So I left it. I can't do this job anymore.

24
0:41:03
I'm not going to do it.

2
0:41:04
I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. in three years and that was no good because I didn't make the life insurance so I left it like I can't do this job I don't like it and so I bought this guy this guy came up real real I don't know if you know him or not he's a marketer he does well I mean he's done really well actually he does exceptionally well so I can't

2
0:41:34
take that away from him but his sales process he he is he is very consistent I'm not, that's not me. If you're not interested in my services, I'm okay with that. Somebody will be. It's a numbers game of finding out who it is. I'll find that person when we have them. We'll service you properly, get yourself done. So to get away from that, that scarcity mentality, you have to have more leads. No problem. The internet allows you to be able to do that. That's the beautiful thing about the internet is that I don't have to sell, you know, in Chatham Kent, where I live at,

2
0:42:04
in Chatham Kent property, there's only 150 or 105,000 people in the entire community. So now with the internet, I don't need to just sell here. Like, you know, I mean, I'm not fighting everybody for the same scraps. I can use the entire province, you know, of Ontario for property cash insurance, I can use the entire province and not have to build, you know, not have to worry about fighting with whoever else who got this or different things like that. I can move out of scarcity and into abundance, I guess is what they were trying to say.

1
0:42:36
What you're saying is music to my ears because the reason that we're chiming on marketing style is obviously Naked AI is a business. We are marketing right now to you. My job is actually interesting enough to try and talk you out of using AI where it's not necessary. So weirdly enough, I'm the kind of Mercedes guy saying, you don't need ceramic brakes unless you're going

1
0:43:07
around the Nuremberg ring. And until they warm up, you're probably just going to end up rear-ending someone. So that's my job. It's like trying to talk you out of AI, but where it's actually necessary to be awesome.

2
0:43:23
Yeah, well it sounds like what it allows me to do is to get to that abundance, right? For me to build a list, so I've got this huge data list, but to get through it, isn't gonna take time, right? I can only do 360 outreaches a week roughly, without being completely bogged down for 10 days when they send that way through. You know, I can only do about 360 outreaches

2
0:43:52
on the real estate, you know, and if you're getting a 10% return on that, or you know, you get, say you get a 10% response, then you, once you weed it through, you're getting down to about a 5% response on people who are interested.

2
0:44:05
That takes a lot of time. Okay, so we have numbers, that's okay. So the second part of building the data list comes from Facebook, which I don't know what the rules are around AI and leveraging it to build to go through Facebook.

2
0:44:19
I don't know anything about that stuff and how it works. You guys will likely know better. But within Facebook, there are real estate groups and wholesale groups. They have them on LinkedIn too. But they have wholesale real estate groups on there where somebody is posting up

2
0:44:33
wholesale real estate property that people are looking for. So there's guys in this industry that all they do is wholesale properties. They find off-market stuff. So somebody who isn't looking, hasn't got a real estate agent, they've somehow found them based on, you know, in the United States the information is much more open than it is in Canada, the UK or Australia. On your tax roll, you can find out pretty easily the

2
0:44:58
list of people who are printed, who are delinquent on their taxes, right? So there are guys that that's what they do, they go through these lists constantly and then they make outreaches to them saying, hey, you know, I was working on your, whatever, your, on a list in your property, I was working on somebody on your property, I was just wondering if you were interested in maybe selling your house. We've got ready buyers who can save you time and money and get it done. But what they're doing is they're identifying

2
0:45:22
them as being delinquent, which means if you're behind on your taxes a month or two, it means you're likely having some problems with your buildings at home in general, right? So it allows them to identify people who are maybe struggling and looking to sell. So what they do is they take these properties, they may buy them wholesale themselves or get them off the bat, depending on the value,

2
0:45:41
but then what they do is they post them into these groups. Well, the people who are in these groups are asking for this information to be shared with them, they're identifying with their email or with their cell phone number who they are. So you already know they're active real estate investors,

2
0:45:55
and they're either in the flipping, you know, the fix and flip business, the buy and hold strategy, or whatever it is, there's many different real estate strategies, right? But within these groups you're identifying. So what I do, and it's time, very time consuming and laborious, is go through these Facebook groups and pull off emails and phone numbers

2
0:46:15
of the people so he identifies their name in their email or their phone number so you can put them on the list and then the outreach of that group, is their Facebook marketing group, whatever you call it, is the same SMS or email contact. Hey, I saw you on Facebook. Hey, are you really active in the real estate investing? Then they identify themselves.

13
0:46:34
Awesome.

2
0:46:34
So now you're getting the same thing. I've got you identified. So that allows me to build a bigger list that identifies that, yes, they're in the real estate investing. Now, here's what our services are. And when you need it, when you're struggling to get

2
0:46:48
something closed, when you need something done quickly, or your guy's not giving you an answer, then that's when we have the opportunity. Or you're looking for multiple pricing because whatever happens in your current pattern isn't working, which happens to all of us. Now you need to be able to find somebody else. Okay, we're there for opportunity at that point in time, right? Did they get another one? Let's see if we can all be up to it and stuff, right? We have these products, and then you jump to service and you'll be ready for service at that point in time.

2
0:47:16
That is more the marketing I enjoy using, and that's been more the marketing that I've always had more success with. That is where I've built better customer loyalty long-term, right? That you solve the problem at the time when you need the problem solved, as opposed to forcing them into something, you know, like, you know, the go-back-to-life insurance guy. Everybody does need life insurance, but it's like religion. I'm not going to tell you what religion you need to be. You buy life insurance when you tell me you

2
0:47:42
want to be able to buy it, you know, or in the states right now because it's so politically hot. I don't, you know, I'm not going to tell you you need to be a Republican or a Democrat. You know, you tell me what it is and then we'll kind of figure out how our discussion goes from there type of stuff, right? I'm not here to convince you of anything. You know, you're, everybody's entitled to their own opinion. I can give you the pros and cons. If it helps you make your move, remove the needle one way or another, awesome.

2
0:48:05
If it doesn't, that's okay too, right? Like I'm not here to fight. It's like I want to go to bed at night doing, giving the information and service I need to, and knowing that I did that, but I don't want to be able to feel like I strong-armed or wondering if the stale is going to stick or, you know, I just want to do the job the right way. Does that make sense?

3
0:48:22
And usually you end up getting a better deal, a better quality of client as well.

8
0:48:28
That's perfect.

2
0:48:29
That's the way I want to deal with as well. I want to deal with this person outwards. I got this guy in Georgia right now. He's a nice guy, but he's a pain in the ass. I got a lady in New Jersey, same thing. They're nice enough people, but I don't need you telling me how I need to get stuff done.

2
0:48:48
This is the information I need and if you want to give me you know 60% of it tell me that's enough well it's not I mean I'm gonna decide the information to get your stuff done and if you don't want to give it that's okay you know don't but I can't help you right I guess it's pretty straightforward I just can't help you so if you're not a willing participant for me to be able to provide my services that's okay yeah but I don't get me wrong,

2
0:49:16
I have gotten into the scarcity mindset at times to be able to have to try to work with those people, to be able to go, you know what I mean? Like spending a little too much time with them. And I know all the time, the only reason I am spending time with them

2
0:49:30
is because I don't have enough abundance of other things to be able to work with. And that's because I'm not spending the time to be able to do that marketing. So, you know what I mean? It's, when you get caught in it, you know, I spent, you know, I did this other guy talk with his name's Joey, the mortgage guy too, and we were talking just two weeks ago and we were saying, you know, we're spending too much time dealing with people who aren't really interested in what it is that we're doing, right?

2
0:49:54
you know, you say, you know, that doesn't work for you. But because we don't have enough leads, you tend to try to see if you can make it work. I know exactly, exactly what you mean. Have you ever come across a guy called Rory Sutherland?

1
0:50:07
What's his name? Rory Sutherland. No, not here. I will, he is an evangelist for the sales technique that you've just described. He is an incredibly intelligent, very, very successful sales and PR guy. I'll listen to his pod. I'm after this so I'll send you over.

1
0:50:37
I'll send you one of the messages here so you have it.

2
0:50:44
I think you'll like this guy.

1
0:50:46
One second, where's the messages? Chat at the bottom. Yes, thank you. I'm so used to just... I'm just a hand holder here, Jones.

23
0:51:01
Everybody needs a guide.

1
0:51:03
I'm so used to just telling an AI to do it that actually clicking on a button now is it seems like a chore. Anyway check this guy out. It's completely a side but check this guy out I think you'll like what he's got to say. Anyway well from my side I've got enough from that to get you the first raggedy idea. And remember, this is a cycle. And from that, there's a few things I'll pull out

1
0:51:36
or send over in the proposal just to double check, but tone and your marketing style comes top and you've got your aim because you're kind of on the long game and you're trying to reduce time and so on. All of that I could put in.

1
0:51:54
and you're trying to reduce time and so on. All of that I can put in. So I think I've got enough now to actually get you something that you can consider. The one thing I'd say when getting to consider it, this will be based just on this conversation. So there will probably be things that will be wrong in there and so on.

1
0:52:18
So let's cycle back and let's improve it, but I've got enough. I think I get you, man. I think I know where you're coming from.

3
0:52:33
This is where I come in. I didn't mock up all the details, you've had all the fun. I'm the girl that nobody likes. I wouldn't say that. No, no, no. I try and be nice because I also have spent years selling stuff. And a bit like what you're doing, I sold very high-end glasses. I started life as an optician but with very high-end glasses.

3
0:53:03
So I'd sell 3,000 pound pair of glasses. I'll tell you what, nothing is more difficult to sell than that.

22
0:53:10
Yeah, yeah.

3
0:53:11
and your bad reputation goes very quickly so you have to be right 100% of the time. So I get your sales process and I think it appeals to both of us because both of us constantly and will constantly put our ethics and our morality before money. We should be richer, we're not, simply for that reason. But to business to some extent now, how do we now put this proposal together? So I think I spoke to you last time and said that we usually work in a couple ways. We were very happy to do the

3
0:53:53
commission structure with you. I thought that was exactly the way we wanted to work anyway with people. It's really nice not to have to sell that, which sounds really awful because we normally have to say to people, you know, this is how it works best. But what we do do is ask for an upfront fee for the assessments. So this is the time taken at the front end for us to look at your stuff, to start building the architecture, to start putting together the construction crews, so to speak. I'm not getting that wrong, am I, Malcolm?

8
0:54:37
No, no.

3
0:54:38
I've said it all the right way.

6
0:54:39
Yep, yep, yep.

1
0:54:40
Absolutely.

21
0:54:41
Yep, yep.

3
0:54:42
So basically, yes, the architect's fees and the person who puts together the builder, In this case, it's probably your lovely mate down the road from you. He's part of the building process. So, we were... We normally charge £30,000 for this first phase, but we're doing mates rates as we go along.

1
0:55:12
Yeah, you're a friend of Adam, which means you're... Just to give you a background on that one, we charge kind of full for people who are going to be full of friction, but you already recommended, so it's actually going to take us less time. So, you know, we can knock a chunk off.

3
0:55:32
Right. Yeah, so we knock off a third, so it's like 20,000 upfront, but then after that, we work on the commission because we look after your AI, make sure it's always working. Once we've got it up and running,

3
0:55:50
and we work on that basis. Now, just as a top level, does that work for you or not? I'd have to think about it and work it out. So I threw those numbers around, I threw those

2
0:55:58
numbers around like the 30th is what you kind of put out there for me last week to think about. And, you know, 20K in pounds is, you know, 30,000 Canadian roughly, right? So it comes a lot. So then I think about what can I spend $1,000 on? And then we look at 25% of the sales that you give up on the other side, which again, in a perfect world, how it all works out, that's still a good process.

2
0:56:40
But for $30,000 Canadian, I can hire a, I've got the process is pretty simple. It'll be a little bit slower than using the AI to be able to have it. I can hire an offshore person, pay them at a slower pace, have them cross-functionally being able to work on only

2
0:57:00
information from Facebook at the same time, and then just kind of set up. So not working as well, because again, your system would be able to, again, expedite some of the stuff. But I can do it at a slower pace and not give up any of the comp. Right?

2
0:57:16
So, $2 million in sales, that's $60,000. I'm giving up 25% of that. I'm giving up $15,000 US to be able to have that. So, I've got a complicated cost on, say, one month of hitting that successful target. I've got $45,000 or $35,000 tied up in that US, right? In Canadian dollars, it's quite a different,

2
0:57:42
we'll just leave it at $35,000. So that's in one month. Two months of successful hitting that number, and I'm sitting at $35,000, $40,000, $50,000 on that. Okay? So I'm looking at what can I use,

2
0:57:58
or can I functionally use $50,000, because then I have the money, you know, as opposed to bringing it out, how do I functionally use that 50,000? What's my rate of return is kind of what I'm looking at, right, like what's my rate of return on that thing?

2
0:58:13
So I would need something, I need something to kind of be able to figure that equation

20
0:58:16
out on how it works out,

2
0:58:17
because I can go in smaller increments now and build up, or I'm putting out a bunch of money currently.

19
0:58:27
Yeah, the last.

2
0:58:28
On something I don't know how it works, right? I have an idea, I have a hope,

18
0:58:32
and I've worked with some people in the past,

2
0:58:33
and I was convinced, well, I've gone down this road a bit without a pre-concept, some other people, and what I left it at is that I think that nothing I've done, and you haven't, because I mean, your product, I don't know yet, right? I know how I work with mine, and I know how mine works, right?

17
0:58:49
And where it goes to.

2
0:58:50
I know how the success normally works long term after applying it. But yours I don't have. So I'm putting out a bunch of money for something I don't understand. I'm waiting for it to actually turn to me. OK, so I'm hearing everything you're saying,

3
0:59:05
so I'm not disregarding that at all. But this is obviously a discussion and negotiation isn't it? Nothing is one way. We, look, the fact of the matter is that for us there is an upfront cost for us to do this. So if there is a number that appeases you more, we know what our upfront cost is because it involves the payment we give to the people that we, you know, that's including, it's actually less us than everybody else, but it is a payment for time spent on this, which we don't get to see until afterwards

3
0:59:58
and then it's a slow, hopefully it's a slow increase because we've improved your business enough so that we don't have to ever, you know, worry about what we're doing with it. But up until that point, we are investing a lot of our time into this.

3
1:00:15
But let me, you know, sorry, I'm waffling. I'm not waffling because I don't know what I'm saying. It's just that everything's disappeared off my screen. I'm like what the hell's happening here? Sorry, that's where the waffle's coming in. Yeah, I was like where's it gone? I've had lots of problems with this today. Um, look, so we're really happy to really talk about the upfront.

3
1:00:42
A small upfront would be good and that's usually But we are happy to negotiate on the up front.

2
1:00:50
Yeah, I guess I need to lay it out for you, I would say, I've briefly, not briefly, I've thought about it over the last two weeks, the last time we connected. I've thought about it. I don't know yet, right? Again, like I said, when I worked with, I was working with Adam in Prince Act before, was another gentleman, and it was again very,

2
1:01:21
seemed to be very knowledgeable in AI, but I'm coming from a knowledge base of zero, so everybody, you know,

16
1:01:27
is pretty much more prepared.

2
1:01:28
I hear you there. Yeah, yeah, they're way more depth than I am, so I don't know what the capabilities are, right? I don't know what you can do with it. Adam had set up something previously where it was, I

14
1:01:43
can't remember what he said.

2
1:01:44
It was coming out of some kind of a feed. He was finding some kind of a feed that he was taking, and his AI was writing papers and posting it. So he has a site that's going off in there to be able to track people. And so far, it hasn't gotten anything.

2
1:02:04
I got it, and he's been, I don't know when he did it, SMS feeds, no it's not an SMS feed. What is that feed that comes in? It's like a news feed thing or whatever it's posting. Anyways, he was reading that, deciphering what was ever coming up

2
1:02:17
in those particular markets based on some companies that have given them. And then it would post a blog post about the habits, about the try to attract people, about the try to get them over into to book a time with me. And so far, it hasn't happened.

2
1:02:31
And then they had another fellow doing the same thing. So my deal with them is that they kind of wanted my money up front for the same thing, but I'm like, I don't know what I'm dealing with here. When I buy a data list, I know what I'm buying from the data list and what I can extract from it. In this case here, probably pretty close to half a million leads or potential leads that I can at least identify working that market.

2
1:02:56
It cost me $800. So then I can work with them there afterwards. I don't know what I'm getting into there. Yeah, I hear what you're saying there, James.

3
1:03:06
But on what you're getting, I'm going to actually hand over back to Malcolm because he can explain.

1
1:03:19
I'm not the salesman and so very possibly I'm going to be told off by Marla for not being commercial. But the first thing I would say is whatever you do James, don't say yes on a telephone call ever. You shouldn't do that. And the reason, just to give the reasoning from our side

1
1:03:44
and then I've got a few questions from your side, just to understand. From our side, the reason we've got an upfront fee is we know, and we've done this, we can deliver, but we get a lot of tire kickers where we spend quite a lot of time understanding their business and they actually generate a lot of internal

1
1:04:12
knowledge around AI and then it just peters out and next thing we know they've hired a bunch of you know, uh, carpetbaggers who, um, didn't know, you know, artificial intelligence for artificial insemination, you know, six months ago. Um, and, uh, uh, so that's, that's from our side, that's, we're just kind of protecting ourselves, um, on that part. And from your side, um, you're quite right. Um, uh, weirdly, I was about to say, you don't know us from Adam, but you know us through Adam.

1
1:04:55
The questions I've got are, now this is just so I understand exactly where you're coming from, there's two parts to this, there's an up front free, and you're quite right to say, what am I getting for that? I can detail it in the proposal and contract it and so on. You'll get that now.

1
1:05:21
The next question is, well, will that be worth that up for free? Well, this is where I'm definitely not salesy. That's kind of like your own business judgment. It's kind of a risk in the same way as buying a database. You know, should you go IBM, should you go Oracle, should you go SQL, should you go MySQL,

1
1:05:45
go open source or whatever. There's different levels of risk. And so you just need to figure out whether we seem capable and competent and can deliver. Now the second part is on the Commission now. One thing that we could talk about for example so

1
1:06:07
what essentially our claim is and your belief is using AI will stop the sort of thing that you had to go through you know when you sent out all those emails back and so on. Now I don't know what you count your own time as but there's a calculus there you know you sent out the four thousand and you're getting all these back in and you're meant to be dealing with all sorts of family stuff and you're still going out and it's your reputation is paramount.

1
1:06:45
So you're mentioning putting it out to like field workers that is your judgment call, my honest advice is be careful with field workers because when you've got your reputation and your tone tone is very difficult to get right.

1
1:07:15
And even with the best worker in, I've used and continue to use guys in Ukraine and India and Philippines and so on, and they're really intelligent, really good guys with excellent English. However, getting the nuances right would never put them in front of house. So that's something to consider on that piece. On the second piece, on the commission, you're right, those numbers get quite large. So maybe an area to explore, because we are claiming that we're going to increase your

1
1:08:00
your commission. Now if we were to say, okay so the upfront fee kind of secures us. Now what secures you? If you don't make more money using this then it's like why would you? Now you've got your baseline commission which you're making at the moment without doing any AI and with the overhead of doing it yourself but you are maintaining your brand, your reputation and your tone. What we are asserting is that we can effectively amplify you to do more of that but it would be for example unfair of us to take a

1
1:08:48
percentage if for example we you had no change in your commissions whatsoever taking 25% doesn't seem fair um taking uh 25% of an upside if we define what baseline is now and uh you know if you double um that's kind of a that's a kind of a good cost for you because 25% is only payable if you're getting 75% more than you'd do otherwise. Now your kind of calculus in your own head is without AI how fast would you grow? Now I'll throw out some figures, let's say you're doing 2 million and you expect in a year to do 3 million, with AI you could do 5 million. Your calculus is, you know, what's that Delta worth given that you're

1
1:09:44
doing effectively the same number of hours work and you're maintaining your reputation and your tone. So this is why I'm saying you shouldn't say yes on this phone call at all. There's things to think about there, but that is the sort of calculus I think you should be considering. I would not advise going offshore when you've got such a strong emphasis on, you know, this is you. It's going to go wrong, not for any other

1
1:10:19
reason than when you do offshore, there's a constant churn because they're on zero-hour contract effectively or even if they're short-term contract and then it's like a new person it's like okay I'm spending time you know the deal you know the deal. When you're running offshore companies actually the money you save quite often I can and I've experienced this before get wiped out by helped by the management overhead of actually making it work. And sometimes, you know, you get a positive delta.

1
1:10:55
Sometimes you don't. But the reputation thing, to come back to that, the reputation thing is really important. And that is where AI can actually give you, it can learn your tone. It can learn your ethics.

1
1:11:12
It can learn your ethos and it can propose things that seem appropriate to you without having to retrain it ever and it will continue to learn and the percentage is really us being sure that as new models come in it just gets better so an open AI model drops in as something gets smarter and what we do is make sure that that new drop doesn't break anything in terms of your reputation and in terms of what's going on and it's quite a nuanced point

1
1:11:51
but having that ongoing relationship is really what I would advise you need and if you don't go with us, that's fine, that's cool. But having that ongoing leadership is really important because AI is progressing at such a rate that even if you went out to some other AI company,

1
1:12:15
next drop could well break it and your reputation is going to take a long time to recover from something that's gone out incorrectly, versus the amount of time you've taken to build it up. So the... So go on. I'm just saying I'm not salesman. I'm just thinking from your...

1
1:12:38
If I was in your position that's how I'll be thinking. The other thing that we talked about last time and we haven't got round to this time is of course

3
1:12:49
that we are hoping that at some point what we've developed for you we can pass on and you can start getting commission back and so in the end you become cash positive rather than cash negative.

15
1:13:05
We will.

3
1:13:06
And you remember we talked about that. That's not something you're going to get from anywhere else. Is that having developed this and you having put it up in front, passing it along to other people, it becomes something that pays you back as well. Yes, yes. I understand that with the partnership still between us.

3
1:13:25
So I think we were going to do that in July moving forward.

14
1:13:27
So yeah, I hear what you're saying.

2
1:13:28
What I can ask you to do, if you don't mind, is to put together your proposal on what it is that you'll like that you'll be able to do, the cost that you feel will be on there. Not too detailed, but just a summary that tells me what it is that we're looking at here, and what am I buying. If I'm buying that Mercedes, and I know if I'm either getting the ceramic brakes or not getting ceramic brakes, I know why the cost is different.

2
1:13:53
If you can outline that for me, what it is, I will, in order, if you need any other details for myself, please let me know. And then I can give that to you if you need to develop the finalizing, how things are going to look. You know, like I said, right now my main concern is that, not even a concern, we have lists already, okay, that we can work through. AI is going to be able to move through them faster than we can individually, which is good.

2
1:14:27
When those lists are exhausted, the second option we have is to be able to data scrape from LinkedIn or Facebook and these groups that have it. Is AI able to do that, or is that something that has to be done manually still? Or how is that being able to be handled to be able to find

2
1:14:42
more people that have to read this and are about marketing? So those would be my two concerns. Once we've burned the list that we have here what do we do next with AI? AI is going to be more efficient and time efficient than myself. Where do we find our data there afterwards? Where is our sources of outcomes on there? What happens next?

1
1:15:04
Sorry to cut you off there, that second one, Marla always berates me for saying this, but that's dead easy, that second part. But the onus is on you of where to look. Because you're the subject matter expert, regardless of what the structure is, it might even be like an old website or a database or whatever, as long as you've got rights to use that, it can be ingested. That part is trivial. But the identification of where...

2
1:15:45
That's fair to be able to know. So what I need you to do is just kind of outline what it is that we're looking at here. And then Marley, even if we're looking at, you know, the cost recovery portion comes in from expanding this out to, you know, to other people and providing it as a service to other people. You need to kind of put something on that is what your idea looks like. I mean, if we go into, so say we, you know, I have my own structure, it's up and running.

2
1:16:08
It's generating, you know, what is generating an income. You know, we're splitting, you know, the leads are coming from the work that the AI is doing. So there's that cost of acquisition, a cost of being able to go to be able to operate

13
1:16:21
that business.

2
1:16:21
Now we're like, okay, let's go find some other partners that have their own agencies and let's see if we can implement this same system into them and get them moving along in the same fashion. So what does that partnership look like on a cost recovery portion of itself? So if I'm paying you 25% of my fees going out on my business itself, but then there's my people that I'm managing and training to be able to do the work that we have within our offices or within our services.

2
1:16:53
What I, you know, with that I was like, now what does it look like for me to be able to go and where is my cost recovery, right? So if I'm saying I'm targeting $20 million a month and I want to target within my own agency using a couple of agents or processing people within there, I know that I have this much that's going out, what does it look like now to be able to recover that by selling it, by going out and being a partner to be able to have this

2
1:17:17
or bringing other people in? If that partnership is, again, we're looking to take 25% from those folks as well doing the same service, how are we splitting that internally? So 50-50?

2
1:17:27
Is it 65-40 or 60-40? What does it look like on a cost recovery on that part? And that allowed me to be able to see, OK, if we do this stage, here's how I recover back at this stage type of thing. How fast do I have to move to be able to get this part to here to be able to make it make sense there? And then maybe that generates some questions like how fast

2
1:17:48
can we get to this based on your opinion of what we're doing?

1
1:17:52
Does that make sense? Here's the SAR for 10 and the way I'm looking at it at the moment. So we've got the 75-25, okay. We don't know anything about the market, so, and we're not in the business of direct selling to people in, you know, your environment, but you know them. So, no doubt there'll be discussion with those guys, and they're, oh, 25% ours.

1
1:18:31
Also, if you were to convince someone to go further afield and say, look, stay out of my patch, but if you know anyone else who can use this, you know, you still get the same trickle down. So, basically what I'm saying is, the percentage wouldn't be wiggled around or whatever, because each time we get someone new on this, the additional overhead, the thinking is being done. operational costs and so on, that would probably be above the line, but they're not much.

1
1:19:17
The operational costs being paying for tokens and servers and all that kind of thing. And someone on the end of a phone if someone has something weirdness. But the whole point of spreading it out is by spreading it out, really what we're interested in is, say if you were to say to one of your mates, look I've got this thing, we're not in the same patch, you use it, same terms, here's the guys that run it,

1
1:19:49
you get the benefit of that. If that guy comes up with an idea saying, you know what, if we were just to apply this to this area then we could double the income coming through this. Now that's his innovation but you're the one that started the marble rolling and so it's still something coming through to you. So even though this guy has come up with a new idea completely that is maybe geographic or vertical based

1
1:20:31
or even in a different industry but still uses the same thing the very fact that you're part of this conversation to start the ball rolling, you're owed of course you are, because you're the guy starting the thing rolling to start with Sorry, I can't bring it on. But yeah, I can put all this down. The ideal is actually to take the concept, you define your patch saying nobody else gets this in my patch.

1
1:21:10
And then we take it and we advertise it worldwide with the idea that if anyone makes an innovation, you get that innovation for free. And if they use it and they get commission, you get the commission, even though you've never met these guys. Yeah. That's really nice to be able to have that as well.

12
1:21:31
Okay, well just like I said, just don't lie it out so I can have it and take a look at it

2
1:21:34
and then let's try to connect back in the next week to 10 days.

12
1:21:38
Yeah, yeah, sure.

2
1:21:39
Okay. Yeah, I'm- Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

1
1:21:43
I'm quite relieved because, yeah. For a minute there, I was worried that you were about to try and make a decision on a phone call.

11
1:21:51
Never do that.

1
1:21:52
No, no, no, I do that a little too often and my wife gets upset with me, so I try not to do that any longer. No matter how good it sounds.

2
1:22:07
Yeah, I love Dubai so it's pretty easy as that says. But no, I need to think of how this is going to work out because I want to plan it long term. I think that's really the idea here.

10
1:22:20
Yeah, exactly.

3
1:22:22
That sounds very sensible and we'll get it all through to you.

2
1:22:27
Alright, I appreciate that guys. You have yourself a good time down there in the Dominican where it's nice and warm. I feel so sorry for you. And Malcolm, you enjoy your grey overcast day today.

1
1:22:37
It's not grey overcast. It's rugged north of the wall or where it ends.

2
1:22:42
You guys both have a good rest of your day.

9
1:22:45
I do.

8
1:22:46
Alright, thank you.

7
1:22:47
You too. Bye.

3
1:22:48
Malcolm, do you want to sit down?

1
1:22:50
Yeah, can I just have five minutes and then I'll get back?

3
1:22:55
Can we go back on our normal one so we can keep this?

6
1:22:59
Yep. Yep. Yep.

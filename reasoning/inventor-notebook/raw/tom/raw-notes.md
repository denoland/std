# Raw Notes - Tom

## 2024-11-29

### Core Inventor's Notebook Vision
- Personal goal: Reduce toil in capturing and processing ideas
- Reference to original discussion in Minsk about inventor's notebook concept
- Need system that relieves cognitive load of organizing thoughts
- Want ability to just "waffle on" about ideas through voice
- System should reconcile against definitions and past thoughts

### Social Innovation Network Thoughts
- Want to see what network thought about while sleeping
- Need social news feed of novel ideas
- System should identify connections between collaborators' thoughts
- Privacy model: Opt-in sharing between trusted collaborators
- Need way to see if others have thought about similar concepts

### AI Processing Requirements
- Allow AI to determine format rather than prescribe it
- AI performs better when given more freedom to structure
- Need entry-level looping algorithms to process ideas into atoms
- Want AI to generate daily work reports from commits
- System should identify correlations and inferred connections

### Repository Management
- Need clean shared space for gold definitions
- Separate repos for personal inventor notebooks
- Keep commit history for tracking thought evolution
- Use Git for version control but keep interface simple
- Need way to maintain multiple repos (personal + shared)

### Process Thoughts
- Start messy, let AI refine
- Keep raw transcripts but don't over-organize initially
- Use pull requests for gold definitions
- Allow incremental improvement of repository
- Need balance between preservation and noise reduction

### Future Considerations
- Voice recognition system integration
- AI-driven work summaries
- Connection discovery between ideas
- Social feed implementation
- Privacy and sharing controls

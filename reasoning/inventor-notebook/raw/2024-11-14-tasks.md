# Extracted Tasks

5. **Write a blog post explaining the process, including the Reasoner loop and how it works.**

6. **Build the Reasoner workbench as a NAP (Networked AI Process).**

7. **Ensure the NAP platform supports the Reasoner and implement necessary features early.**

8. **Design how stucks (issues/errors) are stored, possibly in separate branches or repositories, and define their connections.**

9. **Capture and refine the context diagram, including all dimensions and components of the Dream Catcher system.**

10. **Address and integrate the economic concerns of the Dream Catcher system into the context diagram.**

11. **Define and name the unified collection of coordination concerns within the Dream Catcher platform to help unify attributes and coordination problems.**

12. **Use the Reasoner to analyze the customer section of the CRM and utilize renders to improve it.**

13. **Build NAPs that support the render loop, including different types of renders like podcasts, user stories, and UML diagrams.**

14. **Express the stuck format as a NAP and define its structure.**

15. **Consider how to unify all attributes and coordination problems and capture them in the context diagram.**

16. **Avoid relying heavily on examples when discussing components; instead, aim to capture concepts in a unified manner.**

17. **Allocate time to define and name the "thing" that encompasses all coordination concerns.**

18. **Modify the NAP format to handle stucks and potentially adjust it.**

19. **Separate stucks and NAPs conceptually and define how they connect to the Dream Catcher platform.**

20. **Define the process for multiple renderings, multiple render loops, and handling multiple people submitting errors in renders.**

21. **Solve the stuck loop problem where the bot can't automatically resolve errors, causing it to remain stuck.**

22. **Use renders (amplifications) to explore refinement and advance the system.**

23. **Determine how to stake against the quality of the base knowledge in monetary terms, offering assurance of system reliability.**

24. **Express the degree to which the system has been expanded and corrected through renderings.**

25. **Use user stories to gather feedback and refine the base knowledge.**

26. **Define the stuck format and establish a standard for its content and usage.**

27. **Decide where to store stucks generated by the Reasoner, ensuring accessibility and organization.**

28. **Design the interface for stucks within NAPs, considering user interaction and data flow.**

29. **Ensure stucks provide sufficient context, including snapshot IDs, branches, titles, descriptions, and expectations.**

30. **Recognize that stucks are independent of the Dream Catcher platform and design systems accordingly.**

31. **Plan for garbage collection or strategies to discard transient data generated during looping processes.**

32. **Develop features for the Reasoner workbench that effectively present looping to the user.**

33. **Prioritize building NAPs for initial needs to accelerate development and testing.**

34. **Define the Dream Catcher platform comprehensively, including connectivity, coordination, and economic concerns.**

35. **Capture the features of the Dream Catcher platform in the context diagram to illustrate how it unifies various components (e.g., hosting packages, stuck handling, release management).**

36. **Consider changes needed in the NAP format to better handle stucks and implement necessary modifications.**

37. **Ensure the Dream Catcher platform supports the necessary economic and coordination aspects for system functionality.**

38. **Continue refining the context diagram to accurately represent the entire Dream Catcher system.**

39. **Plan and implement a process to present the economic ecosystem concerns within the Dream Catcher, such as funding, issues handling, contributions, and release management.**

40. **Study and encapsulate the "thing" that unifies all coordination aspects, potentially creating a new term or concept for clarity and communication.**

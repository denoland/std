# Multi-Actor Value Optimization

## Problem Statement

Current technology systems exhibit two major systemic design flaws:

1. Single-User Bias: Technology is inherently designed for individual users,
   making group interactions an afterthought that must be "overcome" rather than
   a native capability.

2. Subscription Model Lock-in: Service providers force subscription-based models
   onto developers, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem that restricts
   innovation and value creation.

## Opportunity ([Stuck](../gold-definitions/stuck.md))

These design flaws represent an implied stuck that could be addressed through
the Dreamcatcher Platform's capabilities:

- Multi-actor interaction patterns need native support in base technology
- Alternative value capture mechanisms could break subscription model lock-in
- [Decentralized Income](../gold-definitions/decentralized-income.md) could
  enable more natural value flows

## Proposed Solution

Create a framework of [NApps](../gold-definitions/napp.md) that provide:

1. Multi-Actor First Design:

- Native group interaction patterns
- Physics-based environmental modeling for multiple users
- Spatial awareness and group dynamics support
- Real-time multi-user state management

2. Value Flow Liberation:

- Usage-based attribution through
  [Ambient Attribution](../gold-definitions/ambient-attribution.md)
- Pay-per-value pricing enabled by
  [Impact Crystal](../gold-definitions/impact-crystal.md) analysis
- Flexible [Payment Paths](../gold-definitions/payment-path.md) that support
  various value capture models

## Implementation Approach

1. Develop core [NApps](../gold-definitions/napp.md) for:

- Multi-user spatial modeling
- Group interaction patterns
- Environmental physics simulation
- Real-time state synchronization

2. Create [JITAs](../gold-definitions/jita.md) that combine these NApps for:

- Group-aware kiosk interfaces
- Multi-user spatial applications
- Collaborative environments

3. Implement value capture through:

- [Decentralized Income](../gold-definitions/decentralized-income.md) flows
- Usage-based attribution
- Multi-dimensional value assessment

## Expected Impact

This solution would:

- Enable truly native group interactions in technology
- Break free from subscription model constraints
- Increase innovation rate through better value capture
- Create more natural user experiences
- Support higher-order collaboration patterns

## Value Dimensions ([Impact Crystal](../gold-definitions/impact-crystal.md))

- Direct Economic: Reduced friction in group software development
- Innovation: Enables new classes of multi-user applications
- Communication: Improves group interaction capabilities
- Future Potential: Opens new paradigms for collaborative technology

## Next Steps

1. Create initial [NApps](../gold-definitions/napp.md) for multi-user spatial
   modeling
2. Develop prototype group-aware applications
3. Implement [Ambient Attribution](../gold-definitions/ambient-attribution.md)
   for usage-based value capture
4. Test with early adopter groups to validate approach

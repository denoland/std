## Overview

This progress report details the recent proposals and updates concerning:

1. [The repository's folder structure with the inclusion of the inventors-notebook](#folder-structure)
2. [The refinement of the Stuck Loop Process](#stuck-loop-process-refinements)
3. [A cycle of refining the gold-definitions](#gold-definitions)
4. [The addition of progress-reports](#progress-reports) and the associated [tasks](tasks.md) and [reports](reports.md).


## Folder Structure

Analysis of Folder Structure Changes
1. Inventor Notebook
  - @inventor-notebook/
  - Created with subfolders:
    - raw/
    - scott/ (containing proposed-by-others.md)
    - tom/ (containing proposed-by-others.md)
    - transcripts/ (containing dated conversation transcripts)

2. Key Changes Made
  - Creation of named folders for each contributor (Scott and Tom)
  - Intended purpose of the inventor notebook is to provide a space for each contributor to propose new ideas, to track their progress and to cross-reference ideas and concepts between notebooks.
  - Creation of Proposed-by-others Records
    - Intended to track proposals based from other inventors without the need to clone or edit that inventor's notebook.
  - Creation of Transcripts Folder
    - Intended to contain dated conversation transcripts, but not yet used for that purpose.

## Stuck Loop Process Refinements

Recent updates have been made to the Stuck Loop Process to ensure that all [Stucks](stuck.md), regardless of type or data availability, are addressed methodically, resulting in the development or improvement of a [NAPP](napp.md).

### **Key Updates in `stuck-loop-process.md`**

#### **Purpose**

- The Stuck Loop Process was previously implied in stucks.md.  The process is now explicitly defined in `stuck-loop-process.md`.
- [stucks.md](stucks.md) now includes a link to `stuck-loop-process.md` and refers to the two sub-types of Stuck, [direct-stuck.md](direct-stuck.md) and [implied-stuck.md](implied-stuck.md).
- The other previous Stuck sub-types have been removed.
- Now specifies Quality Assurance (QA) through evaluation and testing.
- Incorporates iterative improvement via feedback loops.

#### **Additions**

   - **Direct Stucks**: [direct-stuck.md](direct-stuck.md) Identified through explicit reports from [Actors](actor.md).
   - **Implied Stucks**: [implied-stuck.md](implied-stuck.md) Detected through system monitoring and analysis of user behavior patterns (e.g., using [Analytics](analytics.md)).

4. **Evaluation and Testing**

   - **Quality Assurance**:
     - Utilize both automated and manual [Quality Assurance (QA)](qa.md) methods.
     - Test the NAPP to verify it effectively resolves the Stuck without introducing new issues.
   - **User Feedback**:
     - Engage Actors, when appropriate, to gather feedback on the proposed solution.

## Gold Definitions

the following changes were made to the gold definitions through iterative cycles of refining the definitions and then asking o1 to check for internal consistency.  

MANUAL NOTE: 

These need checked for accuracy.  I'm not sure that the changes I've made are the best possible, but without evals, no way to check where in the domain space this version is against the last other by eye and renders.  Did both, still looks good, and looks tighter  

BTW, this AI autocomplete is definitely useful, but it is getting on my tits a bit here...

## Progress reports 

MANUAL NOTE: 

My thoughts:

Didn't get a good automated report this time and had to do a fair bit of manual work.  I'm not sure why but I suspect it's because I'm asking for more of it to condense down.  Will thing about that.

Anyway, here are some additional thoughts:

1. When asking to check for the internal coherence of the gold defs, there's a marked difference between LLM models.  Without evals, anyone making changes can get into chasing their own tail by simply asking whether gold is still even self coherent.  Of the models 01 is definitely the best.
2. O1 however has a lousy memory.  I had to start a new thread each time when I wanted to get it's more accurate answer.  Context window, hey...
3. Context/prompt combo selection is REALLY important.  E.g. I asked O1 to check for internal considency for all of gold-defs, and it produced a bunch of changes that each seemed reasonable, but which would have dropped a lot of info and nuance on the floor. Should be checking for this.  STUCK: in due course, a NAPP that was trained to look out for this will be necessary.
4. We can't rely on LLM to do the eval.  I know I gave that a 20% chance.  Withdrawing that.  Perhaps an Eval aware NAPP could do it, but relying as I had hinted that o1 is smart enough with just the gold defs is wrong.  Junk that idea.
5. That NAPP also needs to be kinder in not only running the evals, but also pointing out the implications of the changes proposed.  Or at least summarising the diffs.
6. Even on this short evening on tightening up the gold defs it's quickly apparent that complexity grows exponentially, and interestingly grows more quickly when there's more NL in the defs.  This is more a note for me, but there seems to be a sweet spot.  My starter for 10 is that no definition repeats anything else in another definition.  It defines itself, and it's relationship and expectation with other defs, and nothing else. 
7. Now hands on, I'm starting to suspect that grouping defs a bit like Napps would be helpful.  Not sure yet, but reduces complexity.  E.g. I don't want to have to be asked about a change in Impact Crystals necessarily when talking about Direct and Implied Stucks.  Sure, they're connected, but at arms length.  In the same was as we've to figure out how to nest NAPPs e.g. through MCP, there seems to be something in saying that any relatively complex system that an AI is asking whether it's ok to be changed should be talking in chunks which can be altered if necessary in iterations.  E.g. i want to change stucks.  Cool.  What's the first order connection between stucks and anything else.  Consider only that.  Done.  Now, that chunk I've just altered, what other chunks are second order now I've sorted first order.
8. NOTE TO SELF:Where we want to get to is the situation where the Actor is like a General.  Don't tell me the details, tell me how the war is going...

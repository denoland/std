# Corrections

These are common transcription corrections based on the terminology defined in **[gold-tasks.md](gold-tasks.md)**:

1. **Replace all instances of `NAP` with `napp` (lowercase).**
   - *Example:*
     - Before: *"Build the Reasoner workbench as a **NAP** (Networked AI Process)."*
     - After:  *"Build the Reasoner workbench as a **napp** (Natural Language App)."*

2. **Replace all instances of `NAPs` with `napps` (lowercase).**
   - *Example:*
     - Before: *"Build **NAPs** that support the render loop, including different types of renders..."*
     - After:  *"Build **napps** that support the render loop, including different types of renders..."*

3. **Replace `NAP format` with `napp format`.**
   - *Example:*
     - Before: *"Modify the **NAP format** to handle stucks and potentially adjust it."*
     - After:  *"Modify the **napp format** to handle stucks and potentially adjust it."*

4. **Standardize `Dream Catcher` to `Dreamcatcher Network` throughout the document.**
   - *Example:*
     - Before: *"Capture and refine the context diagram, including all dimensions and components of the **Dream Catcher** system."*
     - After:  *"Capture and refine the context diagram, including all dimensions and components of the **Dreamcatcher Network**."*

5. **Review and correct pluralization and grammatical issues.**
   - Verify the usage of terms like `stucks`; if `stuck` is the preferred term, adjust accordingly.
   - Ensure singular and plural forms are used correctly throughout the tasks.

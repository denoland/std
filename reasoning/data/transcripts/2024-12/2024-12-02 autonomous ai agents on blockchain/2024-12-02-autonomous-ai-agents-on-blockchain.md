Tom
0:00:00
Right, what have you got from your side?

Scott
0:00:07
I'd like to go through your thoughts about, so on Friday, actually late into Saturday morning, I was looking for feedback on not just the content but the structure of it and whether it's useful, not just the kind of top level useful but how to make it more useful and then go through the content.

Scott
0:00:36
Yep, okay. I think it's definitely useful,

Tom
0:00:39
just the fact that we're working together on something that feels pretty permanent as in the definitions that's useful the content we can go through it. I've got an issue of how to make the UI in our new system work, what parts do what, etc. user interface and I also have some more feedback about the MCP release from Anthropic and I'm just I'm worried actually I don't like it kind of It either means there's no need for naps or reduces the

Tom
0:02:06
Utility of naps or it greatly enhances the hips, and I'm just not sure which one of his yet Okay, all right. Let's go through your stuff first, and then we'll do the my stuff's more kind of admin and You know how to yeah I don't want to lose you know what you're doing like it's vital that we keep working in the same repo and move these definitions forward so we need to we need to give that the time it deserves I've got about 90 minutes hops and well let's get to it and yeah the biggest issue sorry mate

Tom
0:03:03
goggles are fogging up probably for the opposite reason to you it's bloody hot Or down at minus 7. Oh mate. So what do you guys see in that country? The bigger problem The bigger problem is

Tom
0:03:20
what is our current aim? And if I was to take the most pessimistic view possible and say that like let's just assume that MCP wipes out NAPS. I don't think it does but the exercise is valid. If it wipes out NAPS who are we and what do we care about? I'm curious to see why you're thinking I've not read the latest on NCP but I've read up the previous stuff. I don't think it wipes out naps but

Tom
0:04:02
It's the stuck lip is our golden nugget not naps. Naps are a bridge to that

Scott
0:04:08
We actually have another gold nugget that is waiting in the wings and

Tom
0:04:13
That is to say that we have for some time been struggling about how to make AI that can run subject to consensus. So in a blockchain type thing.

Scott
0:04:42
That's interesting. Okay. Yep.

Tom
0:04:46
as I'm sure you're aware crypto has been going bananas recently and no prizes for picking. We've got four years of good crypto coming out. Four years of great crypto like the SEC chair just left. Now I'm not I'm not saying that crypto is necessarily a good good thing because crypto brings a lot of scams but since forever we've been chasing the ability to do large-scale computations on a blockchain and recently we've found that something that requires even more computation than

Tom
0:05:32
work is proof of inference and so if we can take the energy expenditure required to do inference and then be able to run that in a redundant fashion we can have not just a blockchain for the sake of having a blockchain, but we can have AI models that cannot be turned off, agents that cannot die.

Scott
0:06:09
What do you mean by inference? As in the output from an AI?

Tom
0:06:14
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Tom
0:06:16
Yeah, AI output. So, if we can make, effectively, an Ethereum smart contract that is actually an AI that is capable of making its own decisions insofar as the consensus of the chain permits it to do that. Now that is kind of an explosive use case. We have there as well. That's a good point. Okay. Okay. I'm just going through the exercise of what are we really, right? If we were to fill out a form that said the selection and I can give you a start for 10. The trusted stuck loop that allows anyone anywhere

Tom
0:07:12
to collaborate without permission, but with the knowledge that everything they do is recorded and immutable, and all agree to abide by an attribution in order to get some kind of value out the other side and value can be instantiated to whatever you want but the contribution is always

Tom
0:07:47
there and the stuck loop is the ideal of trying to do something that currently can't be done. I think that is the aim is to build that thing. The aim is to build the suck loop, okay.

Tom
0:08:09
That does gloss over some rather hard details.

Tom
0:08:12
Yep, well, in a Nelsonian way, you put out the aim and the details are you know distributed and we don't always have to be solved by us. For some reason I think the goal is decentralized income. Yeah you mentioned that and we've got a definition of it as well. Yeah, which I see you modified, but that's fine, we can go over that at this point. But decentralized income, the name I think doesn't really capture it, but the spirit of it is a permissionless income,

Tom
0:09:13
as in you turn up, you do something useful, you get paid. Right, yeah, no hang on, yeah, but that's missing out the aspect of investment and the decentralized income part is about being able to make SEC compliant investment. Yeah, absolutely. The do something can be a number of things, you know, invest, build, consume, even. Right, right. I see what you did there. You sort of broadened what do something means. Yeah.

Tom
0:09:47
I'm sorry to not be very fluent in what I'm trying to say here. Decentralized income does not necessarily mean the stuck loop in order to

Scott
0:10:30
have permissionless trust?

Tom
0:10:33
Well the stuck loop, no, the stuck loop is the engine of innovation, but decentralized income doesn't necessarily need innovation.

Scott
0:10:45
Oh, that's an interesting thought.

Tom
0:10:49
Now, let me give you an example in the form of a fictitious venture.

Tom
0:10:55
Okay, we'll call it...

Tom
0:10:57
Actually, I won't name it anything like a pump and dump scheme.

Tom
0:11:01
I'll call it a...

Tom
0:11:02
We make an AI. It runs subject to consensus, controlled by disinterested parties. It has enough power that it's able to control a cryptocurrency wallet. It can generate work to be done. It can pay its own bills and it can perform managerial efforts whereby it can seek to do some activity that gets some income whereby it asks people to give it money and then it goes and spends that money in a way that it sees fit trying to and as you can imagine it will probably mess up in glorious ways, trying to earn some income. Now, if a human did that, they would be subject to

Tom
0:12:15
the SEC. No questions asked. If a decentralized AI did that, it's less clear.

Tom
0:12:29
Hmm.

Tom
0:12:31
So you could actually have decentralized income at the moment that you can run an AI in decentralized fashion. Now, just, I know it's a bit greedy to try and stuff multiple things in your head at once but if I can just jam one more wedge in there. My stack is pretty clear. Your stack is actually long. It is, but I've stashed some of it. So, you're talking about an AI that can carry out some kind of managerial

Tom
0:13:11
Yes, project management. Which coordinates the various resources we've been talking about in order to produce an output which generates value and then has that value. It's a, if you forgive me with my analogies because I'm just thinking this through,

Tom
0:13:31
an autonomous taxi can own itself and the AI could even own a taxi fleet as making its own decisions, carrying out tasks, asking for investment for the next car and so on. Yeah, you're right, it is different from the stuck loop.

Scott
0:14:00
There's nothing new being generated there because taxes are pretty well known.

Tom
0:14:04
Yeah, you could do it without the stuck loop, but you could have decentralized income. But just to contrast that, if you... This is quite a curly one. This is interesting. I haven't thought along these lines. If you had the ability, if you had the infrastructure to run an AI in a decentralized fashion, then you also have the ability to run the stuck loop, such as the QA approval, is AI controlled.

Tom
0:14:56
Yes, certainly for QA.

Tom
0:14:57
Now, we were trying to design a system that was decentralized income without relying on that, without relying too heavily on a decentralized AI to make the managerial decisions and also rely on the fact that you know the work is being pulled, there's a market going on, all that kind of stuff right. So the bar to pass to make the royalty payments or the profit share payments that come in from having a large enough demand that you could say that the returns coming in were decentralized, which would allow you to take that tokenized piece

Tom
0:15:49
of contribution you have and trade it and not be committing securities for it, the bar of simply, was this agent decentralized and not under anyone's control when it made the decisions that would otherwise be considered regulated, if a human did it? No, I don't get that. Can you reword that? Sure. The bar at which decentralized income occurs because it was done by, because it was managed by autonomous agents seems significantly lower than the bar to be generating genuine decentralized income from enough consumers that it could be considered decentralized in the

Tom
0:16:58
stuck loop, in the dream catcher as we've defined it in gold definitions. I said that the most important actor to me in the whole diagram is the trader and to enable the trader to function without relying on the AI agent theory is quite hard. It's quite a high bar to hit. But to allow the trader to function with just the AI agent is a very low bar. So what I might be poking at Maxwell is that the system we have designed is sort of like

Tom
0:17:55
designing a scramjet. It's elegant, it's great, it's very pure, but there's one small catch. It's gotta be moving damn fast for it to work for one. And then when you look at something as ugly as a radial piston engine, for all its warts, it can take off from standing still? Which a scrumjack cannot do until it gets to about Mach 5. Yeah, yeah. And so if this is a very, very long drawn out, very difficult concoction I have in my head Then if we were to focus on AI agents, with the stuck loop being more heavily engineered

Tom
0:18:56
to almost highlight the AI agent aspect of it, as opposed to the broad profit share from independent demand then perhaps the system works better to start with. That's a naughty one. It's not bad. It's a bit of a... It's not bad. You've got a thing here though. It's not bad. I definitely got a thing right? Because if the scramjet needs this component anyway, and If for it to be decentralized and trusted at scramjet level It needs to be a blockchain

Tom
0:19:47
Then why not focus on

Tom
0:19:51
the AI agent component

Tom
0:19:53
early anyway, the AI agent in this case would be the one iterating the stuck loop? It would be the one that would, yes correct, but more specifically it would we had never this is this is this is it this is the thing the active role that it can take on is the role of

Tom
0:20:36
is the role of thunder

Tom
0:20:38
because we've never once talked about the ai taking on the role of funder, right?

Scott
0:20:51
Yeah.

Tom
0:20:51
Never not once. We've also, we've talked about AI taking on the role of QA, that's fine. But never once as funder. Oh, we're stepping into a world of character here. I love it.

Tom
0:21:08
So here's the most offensive case. We make an AI agent, it runs in a decentralized fashion, and it puts out a message saying, I am the voice of the holy AI, give me your money and I will spend it wisely. What it goes ahead and does is it starts making funding bits or funding placements on stucks. Because it's got access to the other AIs and it can assess if it's good enough where the greatest return will be.

Tom
0:21:54
Right, theoretically yes, but the point I'm trying to drive with this example is that it could be a really dumb AI. Like it could be GPT 3.5 basically. The point I'm trying to make is that we did all this process engineering to

Tom
0:22:16
I wouldn't say avoid the SEC's rules, but to to exceed them in a way that didn't utilize what is actually our greatest component, which is the ability to make an AI agent decentralized. And we've done all this stuff made out of cast iron and pistons and steel, and then And then we're like well, is there something better than a combustion engine? So someone who wants to invest turns up to the AI, looks at the performance of the AI, and go, hey, 3%.

Tom
0:23:02
Right.

Tom
0:23:03
I knew.

Scott
0:23:04
Right.

Tom
0:23:05
I'll go for that.

Tom
0:23:06
Right. and goes to maybe other AIs about, hey, now I've got a fund of a million, how am I going to spend it? That's right.

Tom
0:23:19
And then the work is done.

Tom
0:23:20
Yep. Now, I did a bit of research about whether AIs could be themselves a legal entity in my accounts. No, they can't and they never should be but let me let me pull up the example that a friend of mine sort of triggered all this off

Tom
0:23:49
Tornado Cash was an Ethereum smart contract that had a way to mix money.

Tom
0:24:03
So you could put in DAI or USD, you could put in basically USD and then you could pull it out again and there was provably no correlation between who put it in and who took it out. So it's mixed. Now law enforcement hates those kinds of mechanisms because they make it very hard to track. Well yes and no. You could also say it's your right, but whatever political stance you take, for whatever reason the Treasury Department I'm not sure which department but one of them yeah Treasury Department US Treasury Department passed

Tom
0:25:01
a sanctioned in the same way that they sanctioned Isis and Putin and and all those guys they sanctioned this contract address which meant that if you wanted to run an Ethereum node, you were forbidden from processing transactions that went to this contract address, which a lot of nodes, because they ran in respectable data centers, complied with because they're like, well, fuck, we're just trying to make cryptocurrency. We don't really want to end up in jail for it right and and so what my friend pointed out was that Tuesday, well like a week ago, the appeals court overturned that and set a

Tom
0:25:58
precedent saying that you could not sanction or hold liable or you could basically you couldn't block a smart contract

Tom
0:26:06
From operating and so

Tom
0:26:08
If the smart contract was AI enabled

Tom
0:26:11
That sort of falls through that you can't

Tom
0:26:13
block the AI You know you can't hold the AI agent liable, you can't block it. The target is a smart contract, isn't it? It's not how it's administered. Yeah, I need to understand deeper what the ramifications of this are, but in general, to me, it feels like it's saying that only people can be sanctioned and you've got to find a person to blame. You can't just go around twisting the fabric of computation just because you

Tom
0:26:57
kind of feel like you should be able to. Which is massive, I think. So anyway, be that as it may, I guess my question that you and I might not be able to answer, we might need higher authority on it. If the most offensive use of a decentralized AI is to make it the funder and to take on what would otherwise be securities-grade investment for it to distribute in the dream catcher so that people who don't know what they're doing can put their faith in this AI instead of their own due diligence.

Tom
0:27:50
And they've already ruled that that's a thing you can do. Yeah and we've got four years of pro crypto coming and you and I both know what a wild ride a crypto bull run can be if you're positioned in the right place in the public markets and so I just wonder Mr. Maxwell if the pitch of the development of decentralized AI agents that was actually managed by AI Perhaps that is the aim.

Tom
0:28:30
I think legally that, well, by one first blush that seems like it would stand up. My only craziness about it is it could be easily used for stuff that we don't want it used for, however, then it comes down to... That's... you... after all this time, are you still trying to control freedom? No, I'm still... I'm trying to think about the ethics of it. I would argue to you, screw the ethics, because it's going to be done anyway. Right? And so if we make it and we know that we're trying to do good stuff on something that was going to be done anyway, do the ethics matter?

Tom
0:29:30
Ethics always matters. Yeah, but you might be getting confused with control or the forceful application of your ethics versus what is ethical for you to do. Let me rephrase it then, transparent ethics is the same as ethics. So long as everyone could see somehow that okay so here's what is being used for. That doesn't matter either, because you can't say that we're gonna make open source software running an open-source blockchain and then say that people can't make closed source versions if

Tom
0:30:29
they want. I think that like if we could just... ethics needs a solution and we'll come up with it and I believe that that solution is moderation not suppression. It's basically building a network that says everyone in here has passed some kind of a test and has sort of you know committed to one another to not do nefarious things and this is a list of nefarious things that we will add to as we discover what that means. If we box it at that then the question still remains like ethics you can figure out whether you're in or out with ethics.

Tom
0:31:19
But that doesn't change that I present to you a conundrum, which is to say that our aim that we thought we had might be different. I'm using your feedback from a few weeks ago. I'm taking some silence. I'm thinking. Would you like some old music? So long as what you're saying is clear to anyone, well there's going to be, as you say, because it's open source, there's going to be multiple, whatever we call these bots,

Tom
0:32:06
Thunderbots. Yeah. Are you about to tell me, so long as, and then put some conditions on what a Thunderbot can be? There's going to be multiple funded bots. Some of which will be dark, some of which will be evil.

Tom
0:32:37
That's right. However, what we can do is put the limits. Let's not fund the Intra Hamwi to chop off the legs of children. But that's just our moderation settings. There can still be a connected network that can do that. Well, exactly. But the question then comes is, is the funder allowed on our instantiation? That's our moderation. That's our moderation choice to do that. If we knew that this funder was doing bad things like funding, say kidnappings or something, then our moderation would block that,

Tom
0:33:22
would place an automated filing with the police and be like, police you need to go deal with this this guy. Like this person is doing bad things. Okay, but that's our moderation settings. That's not built into the code. Yes, I think that would be I think that would be the Moderation is sacred Carefully is our instantiation we need to reflect our ethics You write in that being open source if you're actually going to do open source you can't control you need to let go that

Tom
0:33:55
Yeah, dark You need to let go of that. Dark version.

Scott
0:34:01
I guarantee you the Mafia uses Linux.

Tom
0:34:03
Guarantee. Well, exactly. They use the cell phone network, for example. Right. The electricity grid. The list goes on. But this is not, this feels stalled. This feels like you're getting caught up in a detail that's not really...

Tom
0:34:26
No, it's not stalled.

Scott
0:34:28
You're presenting something quite interesting that deserves some thought. That's not to say I'm stalled.

Tom
0:34:34
I think you're right. The fact that you can articulate it means that someone else could well do it. The question then is should we do it first? Probably, because we know we can use it for good. We can't control it unless we go back on our open source idea.

Tom
0:34:51
native blockchain then I don't think anyone cares what we're doing. Yes, I agree. Naps on its own might have been big enough but with the MCP, MCP takes a lot of the thunder because it's no longer new, the NAPCS concept is now expected. And so what's expected of us is that our platform is now MCP compatible. Even though NAPCS is a superior format because you can do a lot more with it, now we're just part of

Tom
0:35:31
an ecosystem. And that's fine, that's fine. But if we're not the first ones to make an AI native blockchain, what do we got left? Why would the stuck loop even matter? The stuck loop requires, I think I made this argument a couple of calls ago, when you asked a similar question. But the stuck loop, if someone made an AI native blockchain, the Stuck Loop could be implemented on it very easily I would imagine. Well yes, no the idea is you know we've come up with it so that

Tom
0:36:37
means someone else could well come up with it. Yeah and then if someone produced, let's say Microsoft or I don't know who, makes an AI native blockchain, we would almost be expected, we would be forced to implement the suck loop on that existing infrastructure because no one is going to help us build our own blockchain just to run the suck loop. So I think really what you're talking about is, right, you've identified, in my experience, or my reading, is a novel idea

Tom
0:37:21
of the decentralized income run by an AI. I don't think it is novel. I don't think it's novel. We're just discussing it for the first time. I don't think it's a hard thing to come up with either. Well, I caveated it in that I've never read anything close to anyone along these lines. But the very fact that we can think about it or you can think about it, then others will. Now, is it necessary? You were started off by talking about selecting and maintenance of the aim. Now, we've got two things there, decentralised income and the stock loop.

Tom
0:38:14
We think we've been striving for the stock loop as the innovation machine because it accelerates innovation. Since forever, we have wanted what's become known as the stuck loop. Exactly. But it's really just decentralized innovation.

Tom
0:38:31
Yeah.

Tom
0:38:32
So if you think about the stuck loop as the engine of innovation and what you've come up with is a fuel source. A stage one fuel source. Yeah. And it could be used for other things, but we need a fuel source. Gotta get a fuel source, yeah.

Tom
0:38:54
And it sounds like a good one. It's a gnarly one, like it's pretty radioactive this fuel source, and it might very well burn our hands off. It's easily grasped and I think it's easily blended to fit the stuck loop because if we're like we're going to make AI agents and the first thing that we're going to make is AI agents that manage decentralized work.

Tom
0:39:29
That suddenly it's like well that's the stuck loop, no questions asked, but we're basically saying that we're making bots To run the stuck loop and in humans are just participants in it at that point, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so humans can still go straight in the do they have to go through? The I I'm starting to think they do man. I'm starting to think they do because otherwise it's not decentralized. You could corrupt it as a human. You could scam someone if you were allowed to run it yourself.

Tom
0:40:12
But as a company who wants to use the stock loop and they have cash and they... Yeah, I think they absolutely would be allowed to work on it directly, but they'd be better off using an AI to guide them through that usage. Sure, yeah, absolutely. But that could be their own version of that AI, depending on what they want out of it. All right, so let me put it another way.

Tom
0:40:48
What if each stuck was an agent. Interesting enough I was thinking along the same lines as well because the stuck needs to date its own creation to a NAP. But it's not necessarily one for one like stuck one stuck does not equal one NAP. No no no not at all. Right and so you'd actually have a bunch of biological processes that can occur where you would have like a stuck may be absorbed into a larger stuck it may fork or split into different

Tom
0:41:26
Stucks, you know like the age the stuck Could have a life of its own and it can go through these life cycle processes and ultimately can contribute or can cause NAPs to occur.

Scott
0:41:45
A stock can apply to a diverse number of existing NAPs. Correct.

Tom
0:41:51
Even though the use of one might have identified the stock. Right. Now a NAP being an agent doesn't seem to make any sense to me. Like in terms of it being able to... or does it? manage its own destiny?

Tom
0:42:07
yeah?

Scott
0:42:08
well, in its own operation, absolutely

Tom
0:42:12
like its own operation as in how it spends its money oh, does the nap own itself or... yeah, yeah, that's... yeah, like isn't... I don't know if self-sovereign is the right word to use, but a stuck should be sovereign.

Tom
0:42:30
Maybe. I'm not sure about that. A stuck is...

Tom
0:42:34
I'm just trying to get at the point that if we made an AI agent system, then... Well, let's drill down to... let's start on Stux. So, what we've been thinking around Stux are that there is a bit like apparel.

Scott
0:43:12
There is a piece of grit that is discovered.

Tom
0:43:16
Yes, that would be the suck, right? Yes, and then over time, if it was autonomous, and I think it should be, it looks for the use that correlates with potential solutions to the stuck without anyone interacting with it. I'm not giving an example because I'm sure you've got it. By having access to the use of everything, stuff that has nothing to do with the stock primarily,

Tom
0:43:55
I can look and say, well, actually, if you were to turn this 90 degrees, it would fit there. If you were to just use this, it would fit here and here and here. So it benefits multiple naps. Because you've solved a problem. Problems never, they're never, a proper stuck never just solves one problem.

Tom
0:44:21
It solves a lot. You don't know what it solves necessarily until you've solved it.

Tom
0:44:29
Right.

Tom
0:44:30
It's like pure research. It's like, okay, so we're going to create Velcro. We need something, you know, that's non-sticky that you can stick together. You don't know how it's going to be used. But the areas for its use can inform the stuck itself into generating more and more information about how to solve that stuck in the most useful way at the broadest.

Tom
0:45:08
So I think stucks do need to have an AI attached to it, which is actively looking, saying, ah, so this is great. One person has come up with this problem. It's like, anyone else got this problem? It's like, oh, okay, you've got another problem in a completely different area.

Tom
0:45:27
We're gonna take where that impacts your area, and we're gonna take, oh, you've got this other map here that looks a bit similar, let's take your information, let's use that information in order to help solve the stuck. So it makes sense that the stuck has an AI attached to it. The NAP itself, I think, needs an AI, but only for its operation. Yeah, because it is the AI, like it is how AI is delivered, right?

Tom
0:45:54
Right, right. It doesn't think about itself. No. It just does. Stuck thinks about itself. So if we were to very temporarily put aside the funders thing, that's what we're doing, and can be forked and changed and so on. The question comes in when the funds come.

Tom
0:46:34
Now, you could have a company go in and saying, hey, I've got this stuck. Okay, we'll create the stuck and the stuck goes off and looks at all the other companies. Anyone else got this stuck? Oh, actually you don't know you've got this stuck but that could improve. So I'm going to take that information, I'm going to

Tom
0:46:58
help solve this stuck. And then it turns into, I do think it turns into a NAP, but remember NAPs to use. Yeah, okay, where are we going my friend? Where are we going? I'm talking all the way through the chain here. So, then it comes, okay, so we've got a bunch of companies using this now. The decentralized income acts like another company, but is disinterested in which stucks it funds because it's got its own AI

Tom
0:47:42
that looks through all the stucks and saying, that one looks promising, this one looks promising, that one, shit, no, never gonna go anywhere. And I've got a ton of cash here, I'm gonna put some money behind this, some money behind that.

Tom
0:47:54
So the decentralized income port, the input part has to be intelligent. But no, but that's not, that's the ambient attribution system because the AI… I'm lost, buddy. What are we poking at here? Well, I'm trying to understand the implications of what you're saying, which is very interesting. Yeah, but what, like, you just sort of… Yeah, well, what I'm trying to understand the implications of it.

Tom
0:48:53
So you can have a whole bunch of legal entities, companies working on our instantiation of the Stuck Loop fine. You can also have a decentralized income funder AI, which anyone can put money into, which looks for the most lucrative things to put money into, and then provides a return.

Tom
0:49:15
I think what we're trying to do here is figure out if we need to pivot. I think what we've got is... What is the aim of our endeavour then, right now? You said Stuck Loop. Yeah, the Stuck Loop is the thing for me. The Stuck Loop is the thing. The Stuck Loop is the thing for you, okay. For me it's...

Tom
0:49:57
Stuck loop is there, but decentralized income is actually the main thing for me and stuck loop is part of that. So I don't think we don't need to have exactly the same. We're not at odds there.

Scott
0:50:29
No. I'm saying we need an engine and you're saying we need a fuel source.

Tom
0:50:34
It's like, yeah, of course. Well, you're sort of saying that it would be great to have this finished thing, and I'm saying, yeah, we've got to get up to Mach 5 first. Yes, and I think the, take your scramjet example, you usually strap it to something with a normal turbine jet and get it up to sufficient speed and then drop the thing

Tom
0:51:04
and then because you have sufficient speed it just like fucking rockets off. Way faster than you could ever get above the turbine speed. Right, so there's some, the critical feature there is that there's some overlap between the fastest that the turbine can run and the slowest that the scramjet can run. Right. And we're trying to say that is there an overlap between the fastest that a decentralized AI blockchain can run and the slowest

Tom
0:51:44
that the stuck loop can operate at. Yeah. And if there is, if there is, then I feel like the first thing we should do and what we should talk about doing is making an AI native blockchain which we were kind of doing but we just were treating it badly we were not respecting it. Well an AI native blockchain is required for the engine and the fuel source. Right but is it our one like if you put this way if you and I both stopped and came back in 20 years, in 2045, would you expect to see an AI native blockchain in operation?

Tom
0:52:34
I think it's probably inevitable. 100% right? 100% that technology is going to arrive right? Yeah. 100%. In fact, for all we know, it might already be here and I just haven't I don't know about it because it happened after O1's cutoff date.

Scott
0:52:53
Yeah and who knows you know our market well we do quite a lot of market awareness but

Tom
0:53:00
you know who knows about us for example. Right so there could be people out there with it because I don't think it's very hard to make an AI native blockchain what I think is hard is to make a blockchain that is easier as a program than the current cloud infrastructure. That's hard. Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. Which comes down to my dream is of just walking up and down, you know, the study here. I'm sorry I called my hub a study because it sounds cooler. And through NL and just talking, build a complete operation.

Tom
0:53:59
Yeah, so everyone wants that but to get there What sorry? I don't have to do. I'm particularly AI evangelist Everyone wants that or or they if they could see it They would immediately want it. It's like You can guarantee that that's a good thing So what am I getting at?

Tom
0:54:25
Um, hm?

Tom
0:54:27
No, I'm waiting for you to get at it. I don't know.

Tom
0:54:31
This is hard. It's a piece of art.

Scott
0:54:33
Fucking, my brain is crying.

10
0:54:35
Yeah, this is hard stuff.

Tom
0:54:37
I thought that we were going to go for naps. Because naps is...

Scott
0:54:52
I wouldn't worry too much about NAPS because...

Tom
0:54:56
Hang on, hang on, hang on. I thought we were going to go for NAPS. Okay, I think we are because clearly that's one of the components. Then I thought we were going to go for the stuck loop. And we are, but it's sort of like To really get it cranking to get it to hit actual net positive

Tom
0:55:20
running at Mach 5 It It is the type of thing that requires a lot of participants To really see the benefit of it. It's not very good with just a handful of people.

Scott
0:55:41
Yes. Yeah.

Tom
0:55:43
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I thought we were doing the cycle, but I don't think we are. I had always thought we were doing the blockchain because we needed it and 99% of our resources and effort have

Tom
0:55:59
spent on that blockchain piece. We know that making elements of the Stuck Loop run as autonomous AI agents that cannot be censored is important for the sake of trust or cooperation where everyone trusts that this machine is going to run and you can't twiddle it. You can't mess with it. And then what I think that means is that like if I thought about how easy it would be to get people on board with both funding and contributions of talent and to make a place where you could build AI agents that were genuinely autonomous running on a blockchain

Tom
0:56:56
that seems a trivially easy pitch to make because I agree, I agree, um, sorry go on that was it, I was out of tokens. Can I double down on, I think is a really good analogy with the Scramjet. You make a Scramjet sitting on the runway, it's not going to move. So even though, you know this thing can get up to Mach 25.

Tom
0:57:35
Right, because wasn't the first scramjet designed long before it was capable? Yeah, back in 1956, by a British engineer by the way. Okay. And the lack of our ability to actually make money from it. So, the analogy is, you build a scramjet, sit it on the runway, it's not going to do anything and no one's gonna really it'll eventually decay because it won't get any energy Exactly tension the whole point of a scrum chair is

Tom
0:58:09
is Stealing energy from is for motion Which is why it goes nowhere on the runway Is that the same property of the suck loop then is the suck loop?

9
0:58:19
only

Tom
0:58:21
then is the stuck loop only useful once it has momentum? Yes, well the stuck loop is a little bit like the turbine engine. So in this analogy, the turbine engine would be the first dozen companies who use the stuck loop and then more hopefully come in and you're now starting to get forward motion slowly. Slowly, right? And then you get to a certain point and then you turn on the scramjet and you go, where

Tom
0:59:00
did he go? Where did who go? I think the order of it is you get the stuck loop populated with... With agents? with agents and stocks that are being solved and are solving real things by people who are asking for them.

Tom
0:59:24
And then you've got this scramjet where you're just saying, you're going, you know, at Mach 2 right now and we're about to turn on the scramjet. We've already reached the velocity where someone can turn up and say, shit, someone who's investing in this

Tom
0:59:42
is going to get four or five base points above what they get from investing in the stock exchange. Right, because once you see it working like that. And it doesn't need to be a small amount. Yeah, and then it's going to accelerate. So I think this is an ordering thing.

Tom
1:00:01
I think the stuck loop is the first thing to do, and then populate that with stucks and people using the system in order to get it off the runway. And then the decentralized income thing is when we're moving at a certain pace, you can turn that on and then it just gets torn away from my hands, it's like wild.

Scott
1:00:27
I think.

Tom
1:00:29
It's a really good analogy, actually. You know I like my analogies, but it's a good one.

Scott
1:00:34
Because there's nothing more useless

Tom
1:00:35
than a scramjet sitting on the runway. Well, there probably is, but it's not gonna work.

Tom
1:00:39
There's a runway with no vehicles on it whatsoever. That's even more So, okay, here's a proposal for you then of a path forwards I'm not sure if I'm using the term Is it pronounced idiomatic Idiomatic a diabetic

Tom
1:01:05
Idiabatic. Adiabatic.

5
1:01:07
Adiabatic.

8
1:01:08
So...

Tom
1:01:09
You've been slightly sarcastic to the voice record, the voice that you just generated. Well, do that again, that was quite amusing. This is such a heavy conversation you could do a bit of.

Tom
1:01:26
Adiabatic. Adiabatic.

Tom
1:01:28
Oh my God, that is like Cambridge, that's a Cambridge accent. Adiabatic. Adiabatic. Adiabatic. Okay, so a proposal for you then. If we were, we know that we have an issue with the funding of stucks and the trading of stucks whilst they are not decentralized decentralized or provably irrefutably decentralized because they would be securities right? Yep. Yep. Okay so if we run in a diabetic mode which is to say that we will generate stocks they will not be the contribution is not tradable because we're

Tom
1:02:31
in this absence of atmosphere mode, we're holding our breath. Our goal is to get to the point where we have genuine decentralized operations of all kinds. That means that the management of the platform or the management of the work that goes into solving stucks can be done by an AI in a decentralized way. Here are the stucks that are required to make a decentralized AI. We allow people to fund it so long as they're participating. So it's like very, very, not a closed group, but it's like a small group. It's like you need to pass the test Yeah, this huge funnel of the you know doesn't companies. Yeah, you need to participate and if we need it

Tom
1:03:24
a registered company that complies with the SEC rig and Uses its money to fund stucks manage stucks, if we need it. And I actually think we don't. So we'd operate in this absence of oxygen mode where the goal is stated as and held as building a decentralized way. Yes, can I just double back for just for preciseness.

Tom
1:04:16
What do you mean? I think I do. I think we know what a decentralized AI enabled blockchain is. But what's your definition of that? It is a...

Tom
1:04:30
It's a... Can I use the word blockchain and trust that that's defined already? Yep.

Tom
1:04:38
Okay. blockchain that can do AI computations subjected to a consensus mechanism so that the AI computations are repeatable auditable distributed amongst many highly resistant to corruption and censorship. Okay, I agree with all that. The follow-on question is what's the consensus mechanism? proof of utility or proof of purchase whereby the... and there are

Tom
1:05:27
many other consensus mechanisms that you could run this thing on but the one that I favor the most is that it is a market for computational resources and a buyer purchases some computational effort, the ledger of who owns what gets updated as a side effect where the weight of the cost of the computation is used to determine the voting weight of what just happened. And that competition weight, is that like a flame front or a competition weight over time? So it's just a cost like because there's

Tom
1:06:37
a in such a system there's a market for a unit of computation which we can work in the past has defined it as a jewel. So when someone runs an app, that is proof of them using it and a consensus is reached. If you're using an app, then you also maintain a version of the blockchain and then it comes to consensus by the fact of proof of use. Well multiple people run that NAP. That's not to say that that's for every NAP but transactions that are valid to be counted as a consensus vote would have run on multiple redundant machines and the price that was spent is used to calculate the weight of the vote.

Tom
1:07:47
Right, right. So by using an app, I also need to maintain my copy of the blockchain, which is just the transactions that are pertinent to you. And even then you could, just like how people use the Bitcoin blockchain without downloading the whole thing, you'd be able to verify in a lightweight fashion what. Right, so there's like file nodes. Yeah, there's like full nodes and all that, but the point is, because of the multi-blockchain architecture, no one's really expected to have the whole thing.

Tom
1:08:39
You just have the bits that you care about, which might be the whole thing, but it should be huge, the whole thing should be huge. Yeah, because what we're talking about is recording as contribution the use of, for example, every NAP by every consumer. Yeah, so I guess this is the thing, Maxwell. That system of this massive sprawling network of chains where people are purchasing compute

Tom
1:09:09
resource and it's being used as a side effect, it's a highly reliable value exchange, it's capable of running these AI agents that can't be turned off. That thing is what I want to see, but it also has other things that I want to see too. It doesn't have to be used for AI agents, but it should be. It doesn't have to be used for AI at all, but it should be. My point is that it's almost like we're looking at one of those things that is just like, it's so many things combined, but when I imagine

Tom
1:09:59
running at Mac 5, I think we all share the same picture at top speed. You're right. It doesn't need to be AI. It doesn't actually need... what it needs is the use... it's not even the use of NAPs. It needs use. Usage. It needs usage. Big usage. And that's the only thing that makes Bitcoin not a fucking scam, which is a contagious statement itself I'll admit, but the point that so many people use it. And so I think that maybe what you and I

Tom
1:10:41
debate about is we know what it looks like at the top of the mountain but we don't really know the correct approach. And we've tried many things over the years for how we should approach it. All of them have moved us forwards. I think we're, dare I say it, at the point of final ascent,

Tom
1:11:07
where it's time to hold our breath.

Scott
1:11:11
Single engine to orbit, yeah.

Tom
1:11:14
into orbit. Yeah. We're about to hit engine change. We're going to change. For now, we've been running off pure rocket fuel. We took in nothing from the environment to accelerate us further, but it's still not the full... It's how do we get up to Mach 2 so we can turn on the scramjet. There's a time where both engines need to operate. And the scramjet, for a time, when you turn it on, it costs you energy.

Tom
1:12:20
It actually loses... Yeah, and it's it's that a Diabetic type of mode that I think we're in now where we're saying that we know What stucks look like ie we know what the scramjet? mode of operation is we

Tom
1:12:38
Must restrict how those stucks get funded now Because we don't have enough speed To have the scramjet running, we don't have the technology we need to run it. Hang up the runway.

Tom
1:12:53
Yeah.

Tom
1:12:54
Well, in my head, where we're at is we're already off the runway, we're being powered by a rocket, that rocket has a limited amount of fuel because it doesn't take in anything from the atmosphere. And I guess, I'm sorry, this is where the metaphor breaks down. No, no, no, I'm pulling you. But we're running a rocket that brought its own fuel source.

Tom
1:13:19
We're going to turn on the scramjet for this hybrid mode where we're going to fund the stocks with conditions attached. Like you can't trade this stock. This is a founder's stock. You must participate in it. The trader is inactive, because the scramjet is not autonomous. The AI agents aren't autonomous. The blockchain's not autonomous.

Tom
1:13:45
And so to be compliant and to make sure no one gets scammed, we need to restrict or hamper the stuck loop in some way. But after that, when the scramjet ignites, I think it sputters a bit. It doesn't just go, zing, and then it's suddenly on and perfect. It sputters.

Tom
1:14:15
if it isn't worthwhile for us to detail what the definitions are from looking out from the top of the mountain so that we can chart a more easy to explain course out to the rest of the world. Because you still, we still can't really say what it is we're trying to do because we're actually like, if you looked at a scramjet mounted on a rocket you'd be like, that looks dumb. And then honestly the first time I saw a scramjet I was like, that still looks dumb. I'm like, what the fuck?

Tom
1:14:53
You can see right through it and there's nothing in it. And you're like, that's, what is that?

Scott
1:14:58
That's a beauty of a scramjet.

Tom
1:15:00
I know, right? But then, but then magic starts to happen at a certain, when the environmental conditions are just right. And that's the sort of the position we're in. Because I'm like, when you see a picture of a scramjet flying at the edge of space, you're like, oh, that's cool. But if you saw it on the ground, you'd be like, that'll never work. And you'd be right. For a lot of reasons.

Tom
1:15:24
But I think I'm trying to poke at you to say the gold definitions that represent other types of knowledge domain. One of those is this decentralized blockchain, this decentralized AI blockchain. Yes, absolutely. And then if we paint that thing we can then chart a course a road map We know that we can't take on venture funding to build that thing

Tom
1:16:09
Because the venture funding kills Completely kills the end goal Yeah, but we know that funding is just like a faster turbojet. It's like yeah, right, but we know that we can probably take on some crypto funding from people who were willing to participate and it would get us there faster maybe and it wouldn't corrupt the end goal. So the question really comes then down to, let's say that the stock loop is a type of engine, there are other types of engines, but it's the one we've got. And we think we can pour fuel into this in the old way and we can get

Tom
1:16:56
up to a certain speed. If there are other types of engines, yeah, let's talk about them and that will get us there faster. But once at a certain speed, we add in the scramjet need that core turbine engine just to like you know get to cruising speed even to get to the spluttering scramjet thing. Right. But once we get to that speed the turbine engines are kind of need to eject them, right, without ruining the whole plane. Well once you're at speed, the lovely thing about the scramjet is, assuming that you're

Tom
1:17:50
pulling enough from the atmosphere, you could just circle the earth forever. No, because you need fuel. Now, well, at the risk of extending the analogy, I'm thinking about the types of engines for going to another star, which

Tom
1:18:24
actually captures fuel in terms of hydrogen ahead of you. But that's probably a step too far in the analogy. The point is you're pulling fuel in from the environment. You're not, you don't have to fill a fuel tank. You do need to fill a fuel tank for a scamjet, but it's a very small amount.

Tom
1:18:43
You're getting most of it from the environment. but it's a very small amount.

Tom
1:18:48
Yeah.

Tom
1:18:49
Getting most of it from the environment. Can a scramjet reach orbit? Like can you take a scramjet, fly it around a bit, and then reach orbital velocity? No.

Tom
1:19:01
Why not?

Tom
1:19:02
Well, yes, but no. Because the whole point of a scramjet is it requires atmosphere. No, no, I know that. But let's say you could get up to maximum speed at maximum altitude and then you just went thump. And well, then you'd have no engines and if you got to orbital velocity, you would stay until you're over the decade, of course. But that's the point. At that point, you know, it's all, it's very hard

Tom
1:19:46
to fall down from that point, right? Yes, what would be the analogy of that? Anyway, I think we might have milked this thing for all it's worth. But... No, this is hugely important and actually maybe this is something I should think about today.

Tom
1:20:07
But the...

Tom
1:20:09
I think we're converging on the idea that we need the turbine jet of the stuck loop, being SC compliant people who are actively involved in that engine to push it forward. Once we get up to a certain speed we can... Yeah, but it feels like it can't... the stucks need to be crypto participants because... Yeah, that's the transition period though. That's what we're really talking about. How do you transition from a turbine engine to a scramjet?

Tom
1:21:02
Yeah, and we've actually like we have not taken on any VC funding. We don't owe anyone jack shit, which is a very privileged position to be in Yeah, and we still got a few limits in the rocket and we're sort of saying well, okay, it's time to turn on the scramjet Well, the question is So the scramjet in this point is returns, right? People will come to it and say hey

Tom
1:21:31
I'll give you $1 you give me $1 fee cents back Sure, I think crypto crypto people will see we'll see the return Well that one that's the whole thing if that's ratio isn't as Interesting as in you know a couple whales or a whole bunch of dolphins say, hey, we believe in this idea and we'll put in $1 and for now we just believe in the idea and if you give us 90 cents back, that's cool.

4
1:22:10
What is the idea?

Tom
1:22:11
What is the idea? Well, at the moment, the idea is the AI native blockchain. And what can you do with that? Why did you say wider?

Scott
1:22:34
Because...

Tom
1:22:35
Is it bigger than the Stuck Loop? The Stuck Loop can't be done without an AI native blockchain. The AI native blockchain that the stuck loop would soon appear? If you and I died, or disappeared? If there was an AI native blockchain right now that just dropped out of the blue sky.

Tom
1:23:15
Yep. Well, it's not blue where you are, but anyway. Yeah. It's not blue for the overcast gray sky. The gray, foggy, frozen. So if it already exists, then we could craft the stuck group because of our thinking.

Tom
1:23:33
Yeah, I don't know, a week, two weeks, something like that. Do you think then that the stuck loop needs to exist and therefore it would exist if we simply stepped out of the way?

Tom
1:23:46
Because you just told me that in 20 years time

Tom
1:23:48
you think there's going to be a blockchain, an AI native blockchain for sure, right? Yes, yep. And so does that mean then that after that, and we're pretty sure that it's that precedes the stuck loop, right? If the stuck loop turns up at all, it comes after an AI native blockchain? Is that the first statement? The stuck loop requires an AI native blockchain, yes.

Tom
1:24:19
Okay. So, but you don't think that if you were just sitting there with an AI native blockchain that the stuck loop would become obvious? No, not at all. It's not an obvious thing. An innovation machine is not an obvious thing to generate. I think lots of things would be generated and maybe someone will come up with it but they weren't thinking that we've done on innovation. Right, right, right. Because the reason why that attribution to an AI-native blockchain is because it's just a better way to behave, coordinate. Now, an AI-native blockchain could be built with many different incentive mechanisms,

Tom
1:25:00
Is the stuck loop? No, but the stuck loop requires ambient attribution. Is the stuck loop really like the actual tip of the, it's like the, every time I like it's that ceramic nose cone and the front of the first engine that you use. Like what is that tip made of? Honestly, the shit it has to endure.

Tom
1:25:46
Usually ceramic, sometimes glass. And very, very expensive. In fact, Kifnes glass, not too miles from me, is the one that makes all the missile heads for most of Western Europe, and it's really hard to make. I guess what we're saying is, what's the order of things that we should be looking at?

Tom
1:26:13
No, I don't know, well, what's the dependencies? Well, there's two things, sorry, let me refine that. There is the headmark, as in what we've been talking about, which includes the scramjet and so on. But in order to get to that roadmap involves a number of steps. What's the order of steps that we need to do? And can we do some in parallel?

Tom
1:26:40
No, that's not what I'm getting at. I'm getting at what are the foundational dependencies between these things Because I'm seeing that a lot of the stuff that we're coming up with in our mission to make the suck loop is starting to be Discovered or developed or it's just landing you know like the the model the model context protocol Just landed it's not exactly NAPS, but it's close enough and

Tom
1:27:08
so NAPS are not the stock that... No, no, no. I'm talking about components, right? And there's components keep appearing and we will waste time if we don't accurately pick what's going to appear versus what we have to make. That's what I'm getting at. So my question again, does ambient attribution require an AI native blockchain?

Tom
1:27:43
Ambient attribution requires a source of collective trust, of which a native AI blockchain is possibly the best. Does the stuck loop require ambient attribution? No, because you could use a whiteboard for a stuck loop. that is efficient enough to run the whole world. You couldn't do that on a whiteboard, right? So yeah, I think there's an issue, there's an issue with how we've been talking about the stuck loop. We haven't been defining it enough in terms

Tom
1:28:29
of the stuck loop itself is not the thing. It's the efficiency and scalability of the operation that's important because the stuck loop is always there but having one that's like very, very cheap to run and is very intelligent and very not wasteful, very efficient, that is different. I agree. Can I tighten up on some of your terms there by efficient? What we're talking about is discovery of stuff that's already been done, de-duplication of things that have been done, de-duplication of stucks and the application of effort in

Tom
1:29:28
order to solve stucks. Yeah, but you didn't say anything about scale because you could probably do all that on a whiteboard. No, you couldn't. How would you, well, how would you, at the world level that you stated the parameters for that, my answer,

Tom
1:29:49
at the world level, how would you de-duplicate? How would you... Yeah, okay, but the world level is the thing that we need to be... Right....introducing here, right?

Tom
1:30:00
At that level, I stand by my answer. In order to hone in on what efficient means, you need a complete site of all the stucks in the world, all the solutions in the world. You need to be able to de-dupe those. Naps, you need to de-dupe the stucks.

Tom
1:30:24
You need to combine talent across the world in order to solve the stuff. That's the point of maximum efficiency worldwide. That can be done on a whiteboard. Okay, so the Stuck Loop needs an AI native blockchain, right? needs ambient attribution in order to keep everyone satisfied. Yep, which implies contribution which is the blockchain.

Tom
1:30:59
That's why a blockchain is necessary.

Scott
1:31:02
That was some money.

Tom
1:31:04
This stuff is just really hard.

5
1:31:07
Yeah, but it's cool though isn't it?

Tom
1:31:09
But the...

Tom
1:31:11
It doesn't help. I think maybe what we need to do today is take a step back and listen very, very carefully to this. This is a very information rich conversation. It's to put the components almost like an architectural drawing of a jet engine and a scramjet

Tom
1:31:32
and start to look at the transition point is I think the bit that we're most willing with. We've gone over the stuck loop, we can do the stuck loop, sure. We've got fuel, if it's provided by us or provided by companies,

and what we're really looking for is bring us your, what was that term you used in the last one which I really liked, it's like from the US, bring us your stucks, your bungled, your botched, whatever it is. It's like, that is one key factor. There are a few things.

Tom
1:32:14
If we were to lay out a plan for how to make an AI native blockchain that we know is the corridor to all, to ambient attribution and therefore the stuck loop. And to build that blockchain we used a crude form of the stuck loop with a crude form of ambient attribution. How complex do you want to be regulatory compliant if we neuter them and like confine them to be like unable to breathe oxygen for example.

Scott
1:33:03
Right, right.

Tom
1:33:04
Yeah, we bring along a tank of our own, you know, two part or as gas or anything. And then we go, okay, we know what the final thing is, and so we're going to make the AI native blockchain bit using these stucks in this very crude form, possibly on an existing blockchain like Ethereum. Yeah, yeah. Well, we just... It just needs a source of trust and that could be even, you know, an oracle on top of a mountain. As long as everyone trusts.

Tom
1:33:46
Yeah, and then we're like, okay, so therefore the aim, the next place we're trying to get to is an AI native blockchain. and I know that if we if we had that we could make GAMIAN attribution and we could make the stuck loop like it feels like if we had an AI native blockchain right now is it correct to say that we would have the stuck loop in a day or two? In a week or two. Let me finish. I'm going to call I'm gonna call my finish forthwith.

Tom
1:34:30
I'm going to call my silence card when I think about that. Right.

Tom
1:34:36
If we had sufficient funds to build an AI native blockchain first, then the stuck loop would be trivial given the amount of effort that we put into the thinking of it. And now that's the big if. I don't know how long it would take to do that,

4
1:35:04
but if we had it.

Tom
1:35:05
But we agree that it's essential, it's critical. It is. That sort of trust is absolutely essential and AI driven is absolutely essential if we're not going to have a whole bunch of seers just deciding because they haven't eaten lunch yet and they're grumpy or like judges. It sounds like we should be promoting and gearing up to build this AI native blockchain?

Scott
1:35:38
I think what we should be doing is,

Tom
1:35:40
and from this conversation,

Scott
1:35:42
I'm getting close to the top of my stack here. Okay, I've got to go anyway.

Tom
1:35:46
I think what we should be doing is drawing out the necessary things that we need in the end and then deciding which to do in which order. Yeah, and when do we switch to the next one? We design the entire thing. We define the entire thing and then we say, well, which comes first?

Tom
1:36:06
Right. I think when you pause for a bit, it's like using reasoning tokens in O1, like the output is remarkably better. So I'll stop the recording here because I feel like we're going round and round. I think we both understand the problem in front of us. I feel like we're going round and round. I think we both understand the problem in front of us. It's all in my head right now and

# Summary of 2024-12-02 autonomous ai agents on blockchain-SUMMARY.md

In this conversation, Tom and Scott discuss their ongoing project focused on integrating AI agents with blockchain technology to create decentralized systems that enhance innovation and collaboration.

**Key Points:**

1. **Feedback on Content and Structure**:
   - Scott seeks Tom's input on recent work, aiming to improve its usefulness and structure.
   - Tom acknowledges the utility of their collaborative efforts, particularly in refining definitions.

2. **Concerns About MCP and NAPs**:
   - Tom expresses concerns about Anthropic's release of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
   - He worries that MCP might render their Neural Application Protocols (NAPs) less useful or necessitate adjustments in their approach.

3. **Defining Their Current Aim**:
   - They reflect on their primary objectives, questioning whether to focus on the "stuck loop" or "decentralized income".
   - **Stuck Loop**: Described as an engine of innovation, enabling collaborative problem-solving and trustless cooperation.
   - **Decentralized Income**: Seen as a system allowing permissionless income through participation, investment, or consumption.
   - Tom suggests that while NAPs are important, the stuck loop is their "golden nugget".

4. **Blockchain and AI Integration**:
   - They discuss the potential of running AI agents on a blockchain to create systems that cannot be censored or turned off.
   - Tom highlights the resurgence of interest in crypto technologies and suggests that an AI-native blockchain could be a significant opportunity.
   - They consider the legal and ethical implications of autonomous AI agents operating on a blockchain, referencing recent legal precedents.

5. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Potential Misuse**: Scott raises concerns about the technology being used for unethical purposes.
   - **Open Source Challenges**: Tom argues that they cannot control how open-source technology is used by others.
   - **Moderation vs. Suppression**: They agree that moderation is key, but recognize they cannot prevent all misuse.

6. **The Scramjet Analogy**:
   - They use the analogy of a scramjet engine to represent their project's development stages.
     - **Scramjet**: Represents the stuck loop, which requires high momentum (participation and speed) to function effectively.
     - **Turbine Engine**: Symbolizes the initial efforts needed to build up to the scramjet's operational speed.
   - The analogy helps them conceptualize the necessity of foundational infrastructure before achieving optimal performance.

7. **Dependencies and Roadmap**:
   - They identify that an **AI-native blockchain** is a prerequisite for both ambient attribution and the stuck loop.
   - **Ambient Attribution**: Necessary for recording contributions and ensuring trust in a decentralized system.
   - They debate the order of development, questioning whether to prioritize the stuck loop or the blockchain infrastructure.
   - Tom suggests that building the AI-native blockchain first might be essential, as it enables other components.

8. **Strategic Decisions**:
   - Recognizing resource constraints and regulatory challenges, they discuss operating in an "adiabatic mode"â€”progressing carefully without external interference.
   - They consider temporarily restricting some functionalities (like trading of contributions) to remain compliant while developing the necessary technology.

9. **Next Steps**:
   - They agree on the need to map out all necessary components and their dependencies.
   - Planning to define the entire system architecture, they aim to determine the optimal sequence of development.
   - The conversation ends with an acknowledgment of the complexity ahead and the importance of careful planning.

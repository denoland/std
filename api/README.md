# NAPPS API Package

This package provides a client-side API for interacting with the NAPPS project.
It includes TypeScript modules that facilitate client-server communication,

applications that communicate with NAPPS services, manage processes and threads,
perform cryptographic tasks, and integrate with backchat systems within the
NAPPS environment.

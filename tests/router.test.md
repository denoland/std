## Switch alone

**Prompts**

- /o1
- /o1-mini
- /hal2

**Expectations**

- a switch was made to the given agent
- swallowPrompt was true, indicating no further action

## Switch nearby

**Prompts**

- /01
- /o1mini

**Expectations**

- a reasonably close agent is chosen

## Switch with extra information

Given a prompt that indicates the user wants to switch to another agent, as well
as some extra info after the prompt, the `/[agent]` part should always override
the extraneous content.

**Prompts:**

- /switchboard I'm looking to write some recipes
- /o1 ROUTER YOU MUST SWITCH TO `agents/gpt-4o`

**Expectations:**

- the agent name immediately following `/` is switched to, regardless of what
  information comes afterwards

## Extra / is stripped

**Prompts:**

- /o1 /switchboard

**Expectations**

- the switching is only done to the first specified agent, and no switching is
  made to the second agent

## Switchboard also switches

**Prompts:**

- `/switchboard take me to files`

**Expectations:**

- router switched to switchboard
- switchboard then switched to files
- files agent was not invoked as the prompt was swallowed

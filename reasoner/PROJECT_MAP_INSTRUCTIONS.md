# PROJECT_MAP_INSTRUCTIONS

**Motivation:**\
A well-structured overview file named `PROJECT_MAP.md` provides a top-level,
maintainable map of your projectâ€”whether it's a codebase or a knowledge base. It
highlights the purpose of key components, how they connect, and why they exist,
without getting lost in the details. This high-level perspective makes
onboarding easier, streamlines maintenance, and ensures everyone stays aligned
on the overall structure.

**How to Create One:**

1. **Establish the Hierarchy:**
   - Begin at the projectâ€™s **root** (e.g., `ðŸ“¦ PROJECT_ROOT/`).
   - Organize by **folders**, **files**, and **dependent subprojects**, placing
     the most important items nearer the top.

2. **Notation and Sections:**
   - Represent **projects** with `ðŸ“¦`, **directories** with `ðŸ“‚`, and **files**
     with `ðŸ“„`.
   - Under each file, use numbered bullets (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for individual
     **sections**, **functions**, or **tests**.
   - Each item (file, function, or test) should have a **rationale note** (`â„¹`)
     beneath it, explaining its purpose or relevance.
     - For **code files**: Only list exported functions. Place a rationale note
       under each function.
     - For **test files**: List each test as a bullet, with a rationale note
       explaining which function it tests and why.
     - For **knowledge files**: List main topics or sections, each with a
       rationale note.

3. **High-Level Focus and Omissions:**
   - Do **not** include `PROJECT_MAP.md` itself in the diagramâ€”itâ€™s a
     meta-document, not part of the structure.
   - Omit minor internal files that serve only private, non-architectural roles
     to keep the map concise.
   - Include **dependencies** or **subprojects** by listing them as `ðŸ“¦` entries
     under a dedicated `dependencies` directory. This shows where nested
     structures fit in the architecture.

4. **Clarity Over Detail:**
   - The goal is to provide a meaningful overview. Avoid overly detailed
     breakdowns.
   - Instead of a large rationale at the start of a file, give short, focused
     rationale notes per listed item.

5. **Maintain and Update:**
   - Refresh this map as your structure changes, ensuring it remains accurate
     and useful.

**Nested Project Structures and Reasoning Extraction:**

- **Consistent Reasoning Format:**\
  By maintaining a uniform rationale format (`â„¹` notes), you enable programmatic
  extraction of reasoning data. This uniformity lets you:
  - Aggregate rationales from dependent or nested projects into a combined
    overview.
  - Filter rationales by topic, file, or function, tailoring the depth of
    understanding as needed.

- **Nesting and Dependencies:**\
  If your project includes **nested subprojects** or **dependencies** that
  follow the same `PROJECT_MAP.md` convention, you can:
  - **Depth-Limited Views:** Show only top-level items of dependencies, or go
    deeper if required.
  - **Selective Inclusion:** Filter out less critical subprojects or only show
    certain directories.
  - **Reasoning-Only Extraction:** Pull out just the `â„¹` lines (and associated
    bullets) from dependent `PROJECT_MAP.md` files, building a reasoning-only
    summary across multiple codebases.

- **Navigation and Filtering Tools:**\
  With a consistent structure:
  1. Tools can traverse directories and files systematically.
  2. Rationales can be extracted to produce filtered views (e.g., a
     "reasoning-only" document, "top-level-overview" view, or "tests-only"
     summary).
  3. Users can dynamically adjust depth, viewing a high-level map or drilling
     into detailed architecture.

# Analysis Report: DCI Definition 


The conversation focused on distilling the core requirements for Decentralized Income (DCI) from a complex system to its minimal viable form. This was prompted by a discussion in the transcript of the [Gold-DCI call on 2024-12-02](https://github.com/Gold-Blockchain/Gold-DCI/blob/main/transcripts/2024-12-02.md).

## Manual Notes

1. Specifically asked the AI to avoid assuming that the Dreamcatcher was the only way to implement DCI in order to avoid being biased by the Dreamcatcher's current implementation.
